He was once a wild beauty from the Calico Mountains in North Western Nevada.  He still holds his head high with pride &amp; power, charismatically streaming from him.  \n\nThe bureau of Land Management removed him, along with over 1900 other gorgeous wild horses, by helicopter roundups in late 2009 &amp; early 2010.  The Dreadful Calico roundups killed many horses, babies too. I think there were over 80 foals aborted, &amp; some with hooves worn off that had to be euthanized.  My friend Craig Downer, a wildlife ecologist &amp; wild horse advocate, adopted Lightning from the BLM during a special Calico online adoption auction.  Lightning went for one of the highest bids, the highest to my knowledge.  Craig first met Lightning in his wild home!  On his other side, there are a few white lightning strikes that adorn him, and make him a paint palomino.  You can do a search on YOUTUBE for a video of &quot;Lightning &amp; his friends&quot;.

Is it just me or do others think that the west side of the Sacramento River has a severe lack of photo opportunities along the riverwalk. My point is, a whole lot of money was spent on that riverwalk, and it's great for the most part, but you can't see a thing! There are so many ugly, good for nothing Cottonwood trees along the riverbank and all they do is block the view. You can't even think of getting good shots from the walkway, you can barely see the river or downtown skyline. It's four-tenths of a mile between the I Street  and Tower bridges and there's only a handful of locations for photos or even just to catch a nice view.\n\nThis shot is pretty much what I had in mind when I went down there but the area to the south of the bridge is so over-grown with vegetation you don't have many other options and the footing is so bad you're always close to falling down the bank and into the river! Not to mention having to deal with the homeless people getting ready to bed down for the night amongst the jungle.\n\nAs I walked back to my car I was imagining the shots I could have been taking if the view was opened up. Many nice shots to be had from the walkway, with all the landscaping, flowers and that heavy chain to be used as foreground. Get rid of the ugly Cottonwoods (there are some nice ones) and plant a few Dogwoods or Aspen in a few choice locations, Spring Dogwood blossoms and some nice colors in the fall, it becomes a year-round photo destination.\n\nCome on W. Sac, you spent a lot of money on landscaping... Finish the job! Get out the chainsaws!\n\nJust my 2¢...

We discussed film photography, other churches in the area, but what really interested me was his views on worshiping in a church this size.\n\nHe said that it's so big inside the sanctuary that it doesn't feel welcoming; he prefers the smaller churches that have more of a &quot;community&quot; feeling to them when you're gathered together for worship.  I, on the other hand drool at the chance to worship in such a beautiful place like this - I've had the rare privilege to worship in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington D.C. and from my point of view, seeing all the religious artistry that decorates the walls and ceilings helps make the worship experience that much more meaningful.\n\n<a

The title of that image was <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/etnaboris/6090488730\">&quot;Next time you'll see this thing it will not look the same&quot;</a>.\n\nIndeed, it does not look the same, because in the meantime there has been the spectacular paroxysmal eruptive episode of 29 August 2011. At the height of this paroxysm, the southeast flank of the cone was ripped open by a new eruptive fissure, and the shape of the cone changed once more. The result is seen here, from the same view point - the &quot;Belvedere&quot; about 900 m to the southeast of the New Southeast Crater - on 1 September 2011, taken during an INGV routine field survey with colleagues. You can appreciate the deep notch that has been ripped into the near side of the cone, and some slight further growth of the left and right sides of the cone compared to the  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/etnaboris/6090488730\">26 August 2011 picture</a>.\n\nBy the way, just to remember what an exciting month we've had not only at Etna but also at Stromboli: here's the <a href=\"http://www.ct.ingv.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=448\" rel=\"nofollow\">monthly summary on volcanic activity in Sicily for August 2011 at the INGV-Catania web site</a> - thus far only in Italian, English version will be available tomorrow","author":"etnaboris","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7396920@N05/6103095605","pop":538,"lat":37.7407,"lng":15.0087,"mdsy":-0.273672,"mdsx":0.348233,"tags":"italy volcano italia sicily belvedere etna sicilia vulcano 2011 southeastcrater crateredisudest conegrowth crescitadiunconovulcanico","color":"#9aa5ba","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6103095605_4d11f9d5d0_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6900,"w":100,"h":69,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6103095605_4d11f9d5d0_t.jpg","s":83},{"a":39600,"w":240,"h":165,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6103095605_4d11f9d5d0_m.jpg","s":199},{"a":171500,"w":500,"h":343,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6103095605_4d11f9d5d0.jpg","s":414},{"a":280960,"w":640,"h":439,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6103095605_4d11f9d5d0_z.jpg","s":530},{"a":718848,"w":1024,"h":702,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6103095605_4d11f9d5d0_b.jpg","s":848},{"a":7966833,"w":3409,"h":2337,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6103095605_b4bb25fb3a_o.jpg","s":2823}]},{"id":6102504097,"published":1314879929,"title":"different~ explore~ thank you!","text":"ODC~ Flexible\nThe eyes of a cat!

Thanks everyone!\n\nOne of the many Great Egrets populating Disney World.  This one was found near the walkway between Liberty Square and Frontierland in the Magic kingdom.\n\nA large white heron, the Great Egret (Ardea alba) is found across much of the world, from southern Canada southward to Argentina, and in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. It's the largest egret in the Old World, and thus has garnered the name Great White Egret. In the New World, however, the white form of the Great Blue Heron is larger. In the United States, the Great Egret used to be called the American Egret but that was hardly appropriate, since its range extends beyond the Americas and indeed farther than other herons.\nAdult Description\n    Large, all white heron.\n    Long, black legs and feet.\n    Yellow bill is long, stout, and straight.\n    Flies with neck pulled back in S-curve.\nThe Great White Heron, the white form of the Great Blue Heron, has a heavier bill, and pale, not black, legs. \n <a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/great_egret/id\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/great_egret/id</a>","author":"Ray Horwath","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23720661@N08/6104824553","pop":34,"lat":28.4197,"lng":-81.5827,"mdsy":-0.0224728,"mdsx":0.0210895,"tags":"heron birds nikon disney disneyworld wdw waltdisneyworld tamron egret magickingdom greategret frontierland libertysquare ardeaalba whiteheron horwath tamronlens cs5 d700 disneyphotos rayhorwath tamron28mm300mmlens","color":"#607051","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6104824553_8752f1f3d8_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7400,"w":74,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6104824553_8752f1f3d8_t.jpg","s":86},{"a":42720,"w":178,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6104824553_8752f1f3d8_m.jpg","s":207},{"a":185500,"w":371,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6104824553_8752f1f3d8.jpg","s":431},{"a":303360,"w":474,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6104824553_8752f1f3d8_z.jpg","s":551},{"a":777216,"w":759,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6104824553_8752f1f3d8_b.jpg","s":882}]},{"id":6104714002,"published":1314919378,"title":"Pluto (Explored)","text":"Pluto is my roommates dog.

Denver - Downtown - Republic Plaza, Wells Fargo Center","text":"Another from my Aerial archives:\nLooking to the NorthEast, \nShown prominently are two of Denver's three tallest skyscrapers. The tallest being the <b>Republic Plaza</b> (white building, center of image), built in 1984 to a height of <b>714 feet</b> (<b>218 meters</b>). With 56 floors this is the tallest building in Denver. Despite appearing taller the <b>Wells Fargo Center</b> and its 52 floors (top, just right of center) come in at <b>698 feet</b> (<b>213 meters</b>). Built in 1983 the Wells Fargo Center is Denver's 3rd tallest building and is affectionately known locally as the &quot;Cash Register&quot; building. Because of its double-curved shaped roof this is one of the most recognizable and iconic of all of Denver's skyscrapers. In its early history it was also among the most problematic of Denver buildings due to large snow / ice sheets that would form then fall onto the pedestrians below. A unique heating system had to be designed to deal with this problem.","author":"Deep Fried Photography","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/32482854@N02/6103413795","pop":60,"lat":39.745,"lng":-104.99,"mdsy":-0.0639018,"mdsx":-0.192403,"tags":"building skyscraper flying colorado downtown flight denver aerial fromabove cash register aerialphotography wellsfargocenter republicplaza cashregisterbuilding","color":"#825c4e","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6103413795_94782f46f9_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6103413795_94782f46f9_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6103413795_94782f46f9_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6103413795_94782f46f9.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6103413795_94782f46f9_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6103413795_94782f46f9_b.jpg","s":836},{"a":10077696,"w":3888,"h":2592,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6103413795_fe840a3496_o.jpg","s":3175}]},{"id":6102746550,"published":1314869246,"title":"Ambury Farm","text":"Explored | 01.09.2011","author":"puting bagwis","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/35159253@N04/6102746550","pop":62,"lat":-36.9496,"lng":174.763,"mdsy":-0.205826,"mdsx":0.0068133,"tags":"","color":"#9b9a8f","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6072/6102746550_f761a10c57_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6600,"w":100,"h":66,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6072/6102746550_f761a10c57_t.jpg","s":81},{"a":38160,"w":240,"h":159,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6072/6102746550_f761a10c57_m.jpg","s":195},{"a":166000,"w":500,"h":332,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6072/6102746550_f761a10c57.jpg","s":407},{"a":272000,"w":640,"h":425,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6072/6102746550_f761a10c57_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":696320,"w":1024,"h":680,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6072/6102746550_f761a10c57_b.jpg","s":834}]},{"id":6104801096,"published":1314922041,"title":"Great Egret   (Ardea alba)","text":"Explore\nTaken at Ridgefield NWR.

Sundays - speaking of which. If you ever thought about doing strangers, consider starting on a Sunday. Most shops are closed and everyone seems to enjoy just sticking around - waiting for you to take advantage of moments like these.\n\n<u>About this stranger</u>\nMeet Simon, 34 old. A south african who lives in London for more than ten years now. He works as a financier - &quot;You know: Money. Public Policy and stuff&quot;. \n\nHe loves movies by this crazy french guy(?). He liked that movie about the landlord of an apartment building who occasional prepares a delicacy for his odd tenants. as You might have know already: It's Delicatessen by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000466\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean-Pierre Jeunet</a>. &quot;City of lost children&quot; and of course his masterpiece &quot;Amélie&quot; are also to be mentioned here. He didn't like his last effort &quot;Micmacs&quot; and recommended not to watch it since this seemed to be the only Jeunet movie I missed so far.\n\nSimon has a weakness for bikes - apparently everyone in London has. He enjoys to repair and assembling things if life permits the time.\n\nLet's have a look at the things he is carrying: Newspaper, two cups of coffee and a cinnamon roll. &quot;The most aromatic you might get around here, but the best thing about a Sunday mornings are: cinnamon rolls. You should try one of these!&quot; \n\nIt was very nice talking to Simon. The shoot was fun and if he had not remembered why he was actually holding <u>two</u> cups of (in the meantime cold) coffee, it could have been going on and on. So he had to move  on to rejoin his beloved wife in bed. \n\nTherefore he must be the: The Sunday Faced Cupholder.\n\n\n-- ---\nsets <a

I took views both ways the night I took this image of <a href=\"http://bookings.landmarktrust.org.uk/BuildingDetails/Overview/190/The_Library\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Library at Stevenstone</a> and although they weren't shot with the intention of being joined, it is of course the logical thing to do. Technically they don't match at all and so I've had to do a lot of work to pull them close enough for this upload, but even then there is quite a disparity that becomes more obvious the longer you look at it, but the impact is still pretty good I think. \n\nAstronomers turn away now! The 2 images have been aligned for artistic purposes and not accuracy (largely because of the distortion introduced by the fisheye lens and the fact that they weren't shot with the intention of being joined).\n\nAll taken with a Nikon D90 and 10.5mm fisheye lens. Exposure time around 47 secs for the top image and 54 secs for the bottom. Both ISO 800 and f2.8. The building was painted briefly by torchlight (Lenser T7 tactical) to bring it out.\n\nHere is the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rogermoffatt/6093635723/in/photostream/\">original annotated image</a> I took before it dawned on me that I had the top photo as well. I've written a bit about the processing and <a href=\"http://rogermoffatt.com/2011/09/04/amazing-skies-over-devon/\" rel=\"nofollow\">shown the original images over here</a> just to prove that I haven't painted the stars in!\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ukdevon/Stevenstone.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">history of the building is incredibly sad</a> I think. It formed part of a huge mansion complex that was built by the largest landowners in Devon - the Rolle Family. After producing no heirs, the estate was sold off, first in the early 20th Century and later in the 1930's when it was tragically bought by a property developer who basically destroyed it and sold off the stone, lead etc. All that remains today (after being purchased and restored by The Landmark Trust) are two garden buildings - The Library shown above, and The Orangery which faces the library at the end of a small garden. The impressive mansion itself is long gone and all that remains is a sad ivy covered corner at the end of a field.\n\nYou can see the library to the left in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Photographic-Print-Stevenstone-family-Heritage-Images/dp/B001PPLK6W\" rel=\"nofollow\">this print of the original mansion</a> complex.\n","author":"roger.moffatt","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/22464526@N08/6105761404","pop":1490,"lat":50.9547,"lng":-4.09904,"mdsy":-0.00425865,"mdsx":0.52392,"tags":"blue sky building architecture night stars nikon library landmark explore andromeda astronomy jupiter milkyway loggia d90 stevenstone nikond90 astro:subject=milkyway astro:gmt=20110826t2154","color":"#8b5e75","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6105761404_953d2b6c73_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7700,"w":77,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6105761404_953d2b6c73_t.jpg","s":88},{"a":44160,"w":184,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6105761404_953d2b6c73_m.jpg","s":210},{"a":192000,"w":384,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6105761404_953d2b6c73.jpg","s":438},{"a":314240,"w":491,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6105761404_953d2b6c73_z.jpg","s":561},{"a":804864,"w":786,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6105761404_953d2b6c73_b.jpg","s":897},{"a":23944192,"w":4288,"h":5584,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6105761404_622fb31ded_o.jpg","s":4893}]},{"id":6108406842,"published":1315032595,"title":"Reine","text":"Ideal weather and an ideal reflection opportunity as we passed through Reine.

The problem with shooting something that is photographed as much as this is, really isn't a problem at all. To get a unique shot, you're forced to reevaluate the scene rather than just start snapping away like everyone else. Rather than shoot from close up like usual, I decided to shoot from the beach. I walked down the dune until I found a nice little break in the sea oats that would make for some great leading lines to the (now not so dominant) lighthouse. The focal point of the shot changed here from the lighthouse (which is still really what this shot is 'of') to the path leading into the dunes. The fact that the viewer's eyes can wander is why I love landscape photography and why I rarely shoot with anything other than a wide angle lens.

has always been one of my favorite places to shoot.  The city is full of life and character— from the bustling streets to the magnificent harbor.  It is where old meets new and east meets west. For this session, we roamed the streets of Central and Kowloon Island, while battling the intense summer heat to capture and incorporate the contrasting beauty of Hong Kong.  The side of the city that is not so well known among tourists, yet still is distinctively Hong Kong.\nThe couple, Karla and Jan Mike were on a short visit to Hong Kong and we squeezed this shoot into their tight and busy schedule. We could have shot in more locations but the time just wasn’t enough! Nonetheless, it was still an extraordinary shoot!\n\n<i>View the rest of the set <a href=\"http://millanprible.wordpress.com/2011/08/22/karla-jan-mike-contemporary-engagement-session-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>","author":"millan p. rible","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23852850@N04/6106244521","pop":1036,"lat":22.2797,"lng":114.158,"mdsy":-0.174933,"mdsx":-0.142338,"tags":"hongkong kj engagementsession","color":"#9f8073","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6106244521_80f71cb541_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":8600,"w":100,"h":86,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6106244521_80f71cb541_t.jpg","s":93},{"a":49440,"w":240,"h":206,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6106244521_80f71cb541_m.jpg","s":222},{"a":214500,"w":500,"h":429,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6106244521_80f71cb541.jpg","s":463},{"a":351360,"w":640,"h":549,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6106244521_80f71cb541_z.jpg","s":593},{"a":899072,"w":1024,"h":878,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6106244521_80f71cb541_b.jpg","s":948}]},{"id":6106967436,"published":1314988699,"title":"Marcel and Dennis - Strangers #54","text":"This picture is #54 in my 100 strangers project. To find out more about the project and see pictures taken by other photographers go to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/100strangers/\">www.flickr.com/groups/100strangers/</a>.\n\nSometimes, shootings for this project take a different turn from what you expected. Sometimes, you get exactly what you were hoping for. For example a double portrait with shallow depth of field and warm tones, which had been on my wish list for quite a while. Marcel and Dennis were the perfect strangers for this shot. \n\nOften, I find it hard to focus on the technical and creative challenges of a stranger portrait, as I concentrate more on the social aspect of the situation and find it quite absorbing. Also, I'm afraid, people will lose their patience and interest, if I steal more than two or three minutes of their time and would focus too much on camera stuff. \nI found a solution to this problem: Ask! Just ask, whether they will grant me time and patience for trying something new, or whether they'd prefer me just taking a quick snapshot. Duh, it can be that simple! \n\nMarcel and Dennis were funny and easygoing and had time to spare, sitting in front of Marcel's house, just watching people walking by.

No good sunrises,and only two good sunsets.\n\nThis shot is taken at the Owens River S-bends. \n\nOne thing I strive for in my landscape designs is to use colors and layering. Here, I incorporate several layers, each a different color and texture. Each layer has a different 'feel' to it. At the base of the image is the almost smooth water layer reflecting the warm sunset colors. Above that is the green grass with it reedy textures and the fence posts. Above that is the blueish mountains demonstrating atmospheric perspective, where more distant mountains get lighter in color. Finally, the image is topped with a sky layer of interesting cloud textures and colors. Despite this being a two-dimensional presentation, the image has a depth due to the way the layers go together.\n\nThis image made the Flickr Front page as #5. Thanks for all the comments and faves!\n\nWhile I and my friend Walt were photographing this sunset, there was a young bovine who somehow had found an opening in the barbed wire fence. It was on the same side of the fence as we were. It would call and call and its mother on the water side of the fence and she would return its calls. Hope the little guy/gal got back together with the herd.\n\nI created a Gallery called Extraordinary Light with some of the best landscape images I've found on flickr. check it out.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wwwca/galleries/72157627173397957/\">www.flickr.com/photos/wwwca/galleries/72157627173397957/</a>","author":"Bill Wight CA","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21671834@N08/6106627281","pop":1606,"lat":37.6845,"lng":-118.758,"mdsy":-0.0869089,"mdsx":-0.272366,"tags":"california sunset water clouds river sierra mammoth mammothlakes goldenhour highsierra owensriver sbend billwight copyright2011","color":"#997b55","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6106627281_817cca9974_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6106627281_817cca9974_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6106627281_817cca9974_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6106627281_817cca9974.jpg","s":408},{"a":272640,"w":640,"h":426,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6106627281_817cca9974_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":697344,"w":1024,"h":681,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6106627281_817cca9974_b.jpg","s":835}]},{"id":6106612974,"published":1314980613,"title":"Dia de tormenta, playa desierta","text":"","author":"guela66","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/43825763@N08/6106612974","pop":115,"lat":38.9773,"lng":-0.141749,"mdsy":-0.293007,"mdsx":0.225067,"tags":"mar nikon playa arena cruz nubes tormenta roja 1024 nd400 puesto desierta d300s","color":"#acb7b6","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6061/6106612974_411a1f0d49_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6600,"w":100,"h":66,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6061/6106612974_411a1f0d49_t.jpg","s":81},{"a":38160,"w":240,"h":159,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6061/6106612974_411a1f0d49_m.jpg","s":195},{"a":166000,"w":500,"h":332,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6061/6106612974_411a1f0d49.jpg","s":407},{"a":272000,"w":640,"h":425,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6061/6106612974_411a1f0d49_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":696320,"w":1024,"h":680,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6061/6106612974_411a1f0d49_b.jpg","s":834}]},{"id":6108272366,"published":1315027066,"title":"Ingersoll Train Station","text":"So after setting up to take this shot, I was met with the beam of a flashlight.

I then told the cop that I would take 7 images of this building right in front of him, go to the car and process them on my laptop and send him the link to download for him print and hang it on his wall.

Maybe someday my skills and images in this area will begin to approach theirs.\n\n© Lawrence Goldman 2011, All Rights Reserved\nThis work may not be copied, reproduced, republished, edited, downloaded, displayed, modified, transmitted, licensed, transferred, sold, distributed or uploaded in any way without my prior written permission.","author":"lhg_11","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/10455329@N08/6108318922","pop":54,"lat":34.0341,"lng":-118.679,"mdsy":-0.0403372,"mdsx":0.565095,"tags":"photography lifestyle surfing malibu surfers surfboards southerncalifornia activity bigwaves surfriderbeach nikond90 lawrencegoldman lhg11","color":"#4774bc","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6108318922_65fdb9d534_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":4800,"w":100,"h":48,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6108318922_65fdb9d534_t.jpg","s":69},{"a":27840,"w":240,"h":116,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6108318922_65fdb9d534_m.jpg","s":167},{"a":121000,"w":500,"h":242,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6108318922_65fdb9d534.jpg","s":348},{"a":197760,"w":640,"h":309,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6108318922_65fdb9d534_z.jpg","s":445},{"a":506880,"w":1024,"h":495,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6108318922_65fdb9d534_b.jpg","s":712}]},{"id":6106777703,"published":1314997310,"title":"Faroe - Akraberg ( Suduroy )","text":"Canon 450d + EF-S 10-22 + Hitech GND Filters","author":"Spumador","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/43948476@N03/6106777703","pop":70,"lat":61.4143,"lng":-6.70381,"mdsy":0.220107,"mdsx":-0.464011,"tags":"ocean sea lighthouse landscape islands north cliffs atlantic filters hitech 1022 faroe faroer isole gnd suduroy akraberg","color":"#377098","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6106777703_ed488dc4aa_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6106777703_ed488dc4aa_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6106777703_ed488dc4aa_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6106777703_ed488dc4aa.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6106777703_ed488dc4aa_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6106777703_ed488dc4aa_b.jpg","s":836},{"a":1707200,"w":1600,"h":1067,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6106777703_00d357865b_o.jpg","s":1307}]},{"id":6106650753,"published":1314994120,"title":"The Curve of the Earth","text":"The eastern shore of England seen flying high above the English Channel\n\nFrom a point above the surface the horizon appears slightly bent. There is a basic geometrical relationship between this visual curvature ?, the altitude and the Earth's radius. \n\nThe curvature is the reciprocal of the curvature angular radius in radians. A curvature of 1 appears as a circle of an angular radius of 45° corresponding to an altitude of approximately 2640 km above the Earth's surface. At an altitude of 10 km (33,000 ft, the typical cruising altitude of an airliner) the mathematical curvature of the horizon is about 0.056, the same curvature of the rim of circle with a radius of 10 m that is viewed from 56 cm. However, the apparent curvature is less than that due to refraction of light in the atmosphere and because the horizon is often masked by high cloud layers that reduce the altitude above the visual surface.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jekaworldphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit our Website\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jeka-World-Photography/120037331355891?sk=wall/\">Follow us on Facebook</a></a>","author":"Jeka World Photography","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48426512@N07/6106650753","pop":122,"lat":50.6251,"lng":0.615234,"mdsy":0.0946457,"mdsx":-0.636002,"tags":"world ocean uk travel blue sea england sky art english clouds plane landscape photography flying nikon europe earth wing land englishchannel jeka d60 nikond60 theunitedkingdom curveoftheearth jekaworldphotography jeffrosephotography","color":"#3957c6","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6106650753_c73b7d3fd7_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6106650753_c73b7d3fd7_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38640,"w":240,"h":161,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6106650753_c73b7d3fd7_m.jpg","s":197},{"a":167000,"w":500,"h":334,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6106650753_c73b7d3fd7.jpg","s":409},{"a":273920,"w":640,"h":428,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6106650753_c73b7d3fd7_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":701440,"w":1024,"h":685,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6106650753_c73b7d3fd7_b.jpg","s":838},{"a":10036224,"w":3872,"h":2592,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6106650753_5cc96d9f49_o.jpg","s":3168}]},{"id":6106368352,"published":1314975003,"title":"world of blue","text":"camogli, italy","author":"cla pitcha","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/30099929@N00/6106368352","pop":398,"lat":44.3479,"lng":9.15569,"mdsy":0.0265132,"mdsx":0.315222,"tags":"nikon nikkor d90 1685 sea mare blue blu cielo sky nuvole clouds landscape seascape panorama camogli italia italy explore explored","color":"#4c586a","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6106368352_000b66dd5c_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6600,"w":100,"h":66,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6106368352_000b66dd5c_t.jpg","s":81},{"a":38160,"w":240,"h":159,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6106368352_000b66dd5c_m.jpg","s":195},{"a":166000,"w":500,"h":332,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6106368352_000b66dd5c.jpg","s":407},{"a":272000,"w":640,"h":425,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6106368352_000b66dd5c_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":696320,"w":1024,"h":680,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6106368352_000b66dd5c_b.jpg","s":834},{"a":1088000,"w":1280,"h":850,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6106368352_316463a6f5_o.jpg","s":1043}]},{"id":6106059782,"published":1314966648,"title":"7258-N183OYH_Eldon Square","text":"Probably the only time you'll ever see bus station supervisors doing any real work!

Amazingly, the driver kept getting out to help push rather than apply the brakes when it was pushed up, so inevitably it would roll back down and almost flatten the guys pushing it.

This is the time lapse video I took last week when we had some great clouds blow through Seattle. Here is my HDR shot from the same day: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fresnatic/6101186783/\">www.flickr.com/photos/fresnatic/6101186783/</a>\n\n  This video comprises over 700 exposures shot at 1/15 sec and at 5 second intervals. I had to manually press the remote for each exposure, as I do not own an automatic remote...yet! I shot the original images as RAW images, but found the file size to be prohibitive when editing, so I converted them into JPEG's. I figured out how to convert the images into a smooth running video in Photoshop. I have it set at 18 frames per second, which ran smooth in the Quicktime player, but seems to be a tad bit jerky here on Flickr. \n\n Oh well, I hope you enjoy! I watched several times to watch the motion of the clouds and the boat traffic on Elliot Bay. Also watch for the elevators on the Space Needle and the container cranes just to the right of the buildings. View large to see the movement.

Not so for other communities north of us. Over the years, several local families have moved up-state New York, into Schoharie and Middleburgh Counties, (small farming communities). From what they are telling us, and what the news has reported, entire towns, businesses, farms, homes, stores...you name it, have been flooded off the face of the map. Families (many already at or near poverty level) have lost absolutely EVERY possession. I just can't imagine it. Furthermore, they have no communications and for those who didn't lose their homes, power is non-existent. \nOver the next month or so, I will be quite busy assisting, along with others, in the coordination of a food, clothing, furniture and money drive for this area. Scary times for them as most of us go about our lives, &quot;business as usual&quot;.\nWhenever there has been a major disaster, and this is one, the absolutely best and worst can be brought out in our fellow man.\nOur den looks like a warehouse as I prepare, box up and label food, clothing, games, toiletries...you name it. Even pet food. The first cargo bin arrives Tuesday and will be parked at my son's farm. As soon as it is full, which won't be taking long, it makes the 6 hour drive to its destination and the process will continue.\nNeedless to say, I don't anticipate being on Flickr often for a few weeks.

My summer: stayed home and shot lots of photos locally.\n\nExplore~\n\nThanks for all of your kind comments and favs!","author":"RRFjt","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/95017064@N00/6108696635","pop":619,"lat":34.1281,"lng":-116.316,"mdsy":-0.23671,"mdsx":-0.239396,"tags":"desert mojavedesert joshuatreenationalpark hcs stormyskies d90 bsquare joshuatreeca clichesaturday inthelandoflittlerain distantrainstorminthedesert highdesertrainstorm clichesaturdayexplored","color":"#bd9776","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6083/6108696635_73307ed4d6_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":10000,"w":100,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6083/6108696635_73307ed4d6_t.jpg","s":100},{"a":57600,"w":240,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6083/6108696635_73307ed4d6_m.jpg","s":240},{"a":250000,"w":500,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6083/6108696635_73307ed4d6.jpg","s":500},{"a":409600,"w":640,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6083/6108696635_73307ed4d6_z.jpg","s":640},{"a":1048576,"w":1024,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6083/6108696635_73307ed4d6_b.jpg","s":1024}]},{"id":6109024762,"published":1315054754,"title":"Wood Nymph Red Blue Green","text":"Camera Nikon D5000\nExposure 266\nAperture f/8.0\nFocal Length 18 mm\nISO Speed 200","author":"BDMbeercan","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46259338@N06/6109024762","pop":2577,"lat":54.6595,"lng":-1.45557,"mdsy":0.297655,"mdsx":-0.359329,"tags":"lightpainting hardwickcountrypark nikond5000 bdmorris","color":"#2c5a7a","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6109024762_6d2808c3b3_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6200,"w":100,"h":62,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6109024762_6d2808c3b3_t.jpg","s":79},{"a":35760,"w":240,"h":149,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6109024762_6d2808c3b3_m.jpg","s":189},{"a":155500,"w":500,"h":311,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6109024762_6d2808c3b3.jpg","s":394},{"a":254720,"w":640,"h":398,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6109024762_6d2808c3b3_z.jpg","s":505},{"a":652288,"w":1024,"h":637,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6109024762_6d2808c3b3_b.jpg","s":808},{"a":895200,"w":1200,"h":746,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6078/6109024762_f6dcfae2ca_o.jpg","s":946}]},{"id":6108992054,"published":1315053803,"title":"No salmon but beautiful landscape.","text":"Went with my friend trying to catch a salmon, but the weather was not good for fishing.

and Charles Bridge","text":"Prague ( /?pr???/; Czech: Praha pronounced [?pra?a] ( listen)) is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.3 million people, while its metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of over 2.3 million. The city has a temperate oceanic climate with warm summers and chilly winters.\nPrague has been a political, cultural and economic centre of Europe and particularly central Europe during its 1,100 year existence. For centuries, during the Gothic and Renaissance eras, Prague was the permanent seat of two Holy Roman Emperors and thus was also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire. Later it was an important city in the Habsburg Monarchy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and after World War I became the capital of Czechoslovakia. The city played major roles in the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, and in 20th-century history, during both World Wars and the post-war Communist era.\nPrague is home to a number of famous cultural attractions, many of which survived the violence and destruction of twentieth century Europe. Main attractions include the following: Prague Castle, the Charles Bridge, Old Town Square, the Jewish Quarter, the Lennon Wall, and Pet?ín hill. Since 1992, the extensive historic centre of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\nPrague boasts more than ten major museums, along with countless theatres, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. Also, Prague is home to a wide range of public and private schools, including the famous Charles University. Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination, and the city receives more than 4.1 million international visitors annually, as of 2009. Prague is classified as a global city.\nA modern public transportation system connects the city. Prague is also accessible by road, train, and air.\n\n\nAbout Charles Bridge:\n\nThe Charles Bridge (Czech: Karl?v most  listen (help·info)) is a famous historic bridge that crosses the Vltava river in Prague, Czech Republic. Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century. As the only means of crossing the river Vltava (Moldau) until 1841, the Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. This &quot;solid-land&quot; connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe. The bridge was originally called the Stone Bridge (Kamenný most) or the Prague Bridge (Pražský most) but has been the &quot;Charles Bridge&quot; since 1870.\nThe bridge is 516 meters long and nearly 10 meters wide, resting on 16 arches shielded by ice guards. It is protected by three bridge towers, two of them on the Lesser Quarter side and the third one on the Old Town side. The Old Town bridge tower is often considered to be one of the most astonishing civil gothic-style buildings in the world. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700 but now all replaced by replicas.\nDuring the night the Charles Bridge is a quiet place. But during the day it changes its face into a very busy place, with painters, owners of kiosks and other traders alongside numerous tourists crossing the bridge.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jekaworldphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit our Website\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jeka-World-Photography/120037331355891?sk=wall/\">Follow us on Facebook</a></a>","author":"Jeka World Photography","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48426512@N07/6109894452","pop":164,"lat":50.0696,"lng":14.4168,"mdsy":-0.0546795,"mdsx":0.515348,"tags":"world travel bridge art river photography nikon europe czech prague gothic praha czechrepublic charlesbridge vltava d60 nikond60 jekaworldphotography jeffrosephotography","color":"#5471b0","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6069/6109894452_00dfb46df7_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6069/6109894452_00dfb46df7_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38640,"w":240,"h":161,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6069/6109894452_00dfb46df7_m.jpg","s":197},{"a":167000,"w":500,"h":334,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6069/6109894452_00dfb46df7.jpg","s":409},{"a":273920,"w":640,"h":428,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6069/6109894452_00dfb46df7_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":701440,"w":1024,"h":685,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6069/6109894452_00dfb46df7_b.jpg","s":838},{"a":10036224,"w":3872,"h":2592,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6069/6109894452_cc4c6d1cd7_o.jpg","s":3168}]},{"id":6111502726,"published":1315114899,"title":"","text":"","author":"Molly Hare","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/86649749@N00/6111502726","pop":297,"lat":37.7685,"lng":-122.49,"mdsy":-0.0444562,"mdsx":-0.0960087,"tags":"sanfrancisco goldengatepark trees light film 35mm pentax fujifilm spotmatic dust pentaxspotmatic explored","color":"#6c5d4c","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6111502726_68e9d0eb7a_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6600,"w":100,"h":66,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6111502726_68e9d0eb7a_t.jpg","s":81},{"a":38160,"w":240,"h":159,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6111502726_68e9d0eb7a_m.jpg","s":195},{"a":166000,"w":500,"h":332,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6111502726_68e9d0eb7a.jpg","s":407},{"a":272000,"w":640,"h":425,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6111502726_68e9d0eb7a_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":696320,"w":1024,"h":680,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6111502726_68e9d0eb7a_b.jpg","s":834}]},{"id":6110454650,"published":1315086925,"title":"","text":"&quot;Read the street in front of you by saying to yourself everything that you see happening both near you and coming toward you (the text of the street), and the picture will present itself.&quot; - Joel Meyerowitz","author":"admanchester LRPS","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/84625484@N00/6110454650","pop":360,"lat":51.3682,"lng":1.04198,"mdsy":-0.231776,"mdsx":-0.35467,"tags":"uk summer english streetphotography beachhut whitstable normanrockwell spnp","color":"#cdb062","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6110454650_9bd3f1db38_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6400,"w":100,"h":64,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6110454650_9bd3f1db38_t.jpg","s":80},{"a":37200,"w":240,"h":155,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6110454650_9bd3f1db38_m.jpg","s":193},{"a":161000,"w":500,"h":322,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6110454650_9bd3f1db38.jpg","s":401},{"a":264320,"w":640,"h":413,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6110454650_9bd3f1db38_z.jpg","s":514},{"a":675840,"w":1024,"h":660,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6110454650_9bd3f1db38_b.jpg","s":822},{"a":8835358,"w":3703,"h":2386,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6191/6110454650_621853407d_o.jpg","s":2972}]},{"id":6110047206,"published":1315077829,"title":"Let us start with something unspectacular. *Explored*","text":"Today i was in London.. no Prais .. ohhh no it really was Frankfurt :P\n\nHave a look at a friends picture !

Long Exposure of ~60 seconds\nScanned on Epson V600 using Epson software. No color correction, no cropping. \nLight unsharp mask, removal of a few specks of dust and very few scratches. \n\nWhen the people at Kodak said Ektar has no grain, they weren't messing about. I submit that the film has effectively outresolved the lens on my V600; one arrives at pixelation before seeing any grain. I will make a higher resolution scan shortly (this is around 4900 along the edge), but wanted to present this photograph as an example of a superlative emulsion. Will probably crop the foreground marginally. \nThe photograph was made at night at the boulevard in TST, Kowloon, at the water's edge. The camera was stabilized on a concrete pillar jutting out of the water.

Viele Demonstranten versuchten sich den Rechtsextremisten in den Weg zu stellen. Ein Großaufgebot der Polizei verhinderte dies, indem sie die Aufmarschstrecke der Neonazis weitgehend abriegelte. Dabei kam es zu in der Nordstadt immer wieder zu Ausschreitungen. Die Polizei setzte dabei Wasserwerfer, Pfefferspray und Tränengasgranaten gegen die Nazigegner ein.</b>\n\nBei Aktionen gegen einen Aufmarsch von Neonazis in Dortmund hat es am 03.09.2011 schwere Ausschreitungen gegeben. Immer wieder versuchten Gegendemonstranten auf die Route des rechten Aufmarsches zu gelangen, die sich in der hermetisch abgeriegelten Nordstadt befand. Dabei versuchten einige hundert Gegendemonstranten, Polizeiabsperrungen zu durchbrechen. \n\nDabei setzten die Polizeibeamten, massiv Pfefferspray, Tränengasgranaten und auch Wasserwerfer gegen die Protestierer ein. Später kesselte die Polizei  mindestens zwei Gruppen mit rund 100 Gegendemonstranten  ein, darunter Kinder und Jugendliche. Insgesamt wurden über 270 Demonstranten festgenommen, darunter waren ein Drittel Jugendliche und ein gesuchter Neonazi. Verletzt wurden laut Polizei auch 16 Demonstranten.\n\nSeit Jahren nutzen Neonazis den Nationalen Antikriegstag, der zum siebten Mal stattfand, in Dortmund für ihre Aufmärsche. In den vergangenen zwei Jahren,  entwickelte sich der “Nationale Antikriegstag” aufgrund fehlenden Aufmarsches zum Fiasko für die Neonazis.  Aus diesem Grund haben die Nazis in diesem Jahr noch einmal versucht werden, besonders intensiv zu mobilisieren. \n\nDennoch waren statt der erwarteten 1.000 Neonazis gerade einmal  700 Rechtsextreme zum dem genehmigten Aufmarsch erschienen. Sie zogen am Nachmittag durch die Nordstadt, die durch einen hohen Migrantenanteil geprägt ist. Der Aufmarsch blieb ohne besondere Vorkommnisse. Bereits am Vormittag hatten Protestkundgebungen gegen diesen Aufmarsch begonnen. An den Gegendemonstrationen beteiligten sich über 10.000 Menschen, darunter zahlreiche Politiker.\n\n<b>++++++++++++++</b>\n \nplease follow me - check:\n<b>http://twitter.com/pm_cheung</b>\n \n<b>++++++++++++++</b>\n \n<b>Rechtlicher Hinweis:</b>\n \nDenken Sie bitte daran, alle Bilder sind urheberrechtlich geschützt. \n \n<b>Dies bedeutet im Einzelnen:</b>\nAlle hier abrufbaren Medien (Bilder oder anderes) sind durch das Urheberrecht (§ 2 Abs. 2 UrhG) geschützt und sind Eigentum des Urhebers.

I think this is actually the third photo I've posted of the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/6081335072/\">Iron Lady</a>, but it's because she's simply so photogenic. And it's not like I haven't made each of the photos of her completely different!\n\nEvery hour on the hour at night (until just after 01:00) the Eiffel Tower sparkles for 5 minutes. This used to be ten minutes, but a few years ago, they cut this in half to save energy and become more green. I congratulate them for this. What I didn't realise until I saw this photo, is that the sparkling lights are blue, so when you capture the event using a long exposure, the tower ends up a different colour.\n\nThis night shot looks better <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/6113947993/lightbox/\">on black</a> (press L) and this make the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/5986370132/\">beautiful iconic tower</a> stand out even more. I was away this weekend, so I'll try and catch up on all your photos this week. I'm also away again this Thursday, so sorry if my comments and favourites are a bit sparse.\n\n<b>Edit:</b>\nSorry if I've just faved your photo, but not left a comment; it's all I've got time for at the minute and I figured it would be better than nothing at all. If I get more time, I'll go round again and add some comments in.\n\n<b>No images in comments please.</b>\n\n<b>Details</b>\n<i>Canon EOS 5D Mark II / ISO 200 / f/5.6 / 17-40mm @ 40mm</i>","author":"TheFella","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/11224136@N07/6113947993","pop":2736,"lat":48.8562,"lng":2.29771,"mdsy":0.0339325,"mdsx":-0.16192,"tags":"longexposure blue slr tower night digital photoshop canon french eos lights photo high iron dynamic eiffeltower landmark fair eiffel icon sparkle explore nighttime photograph latoureiffel champdemars processing worlds slowshutter 5d dslr range sparkling hdr highdynamicrange lattice worldsfair markii gustave litup eiffeltour postprocessing gustaveeiffel photomatix explored theironlady ladamedefer thefella 5dmarkii conormacneill puddlediron thefellaphotography","color":"#6a663c","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6113947993_ac4aa5c31c_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6113947993_ac4aa5c31c_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6113947993_ac4aa5c31c_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6113947993_ac4aa5c31c.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6113947993_ac4aa5c31c_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6113947993_ac4aa5c31c_b.jpg","s":836}]},{"id":6112111134,"published":1315134376,"title":"Triptychs of Strangers #20, The Analog Lover - London","text":"<b>+++ see the whole set of this project (19 more triptychs) <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/sets/72157626117942754\"><strong>Triptychs of Strangers </strong></a> +++</b>\n\n<u>About this series</u>\nWow. It's number #20 … in seven months. Mmmh, that's not much compared all the other strangers series. But I feel no pressure to shoot, publish every day, week whatsoever. Could you imagine seeing people in the streets in (three) pieces all the time? Well, I couldn't - haha. That's why things keep going on rather slow.\n\nSo I call this the 20th anniversary because I have only four more left and stranger #25 might take some time again ;-). Thanks for your encouraging comments and faves during this series.\n\n<u>Story about this shot</u>\nI was sticking around London Fields. If you make it there on a Saturday you <del>should</del> must visit the <a href=\"http://www.broadwaymarket.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Broadway Market</a>. It`s a less crowded Market compared to Sunday Up Market and feels like being among locals. A few pubs and cafes, but also a small market very selected tasty delicacies, clothes, music, a neat atmosphere in general … a stall selling old prints of old London: The place where I recognized his awesome camera … Yeah, it's a photographer. Asking a like-minded to participate in any photographic project is as easy as pie. The weakest victim you might find in the streets wherever you are, bird of prey.\n\n<u>About this stranger</u>\nMeet the Stranger #20 with the melodic name Kim Tae Hwan. He is 35 years old and maybe our first real celebrity - he is a fashion/editorial photographer mostly working for Elle, Dazed and Confused or Cosmopolitan. But I also enjoyed his efforts in street and beauty. \nHis clients book him because of his very own signature. Now you are right to say: that's the minimum you should expect from a professional photographer. But most of his releases for fashion are on polaroid, at least they are in fact analog. I think that's quite unusual … so in that very moment he was telling me his story with this antique jewel in this hands … I thought this guy must be an analog lover.\n\nLook a his amazing work on his <a href=\"http://www.circus-studio.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a>. \n\nKim Tae Hwan <del>lives</del> is from Busan, the second biggest city in South Korea. He spends most of the time traveling around the world - a citizen of the world. I really wonder how many stamps he might have in his passport. He just finished a video shoot in London and had a few days left to spend.\n\nIt was really fun talking to him. We had some minor lost in translation kinda like problems, but luckily his was his korean entourage of two and one of them was actually living in London.\n\n\n-- ---\nsets <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/sets/72157627575263902/with/6099270675/\">London</a>, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/sets/72157626117942754\"><strong>Triptychs of Strangers </strong></a> or <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/sets/72157625940667541/\">Strangers</a> |  follow <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/theblackstar/relationship/\">flickr</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104045511944341391917\" rel=\"nofollow\">google+</a>, <a href=\"http://thenonewhitestar.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a> or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/adde_adesokan/\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter</a>","author":"theblackstar","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/54880604@N06/6112111134","pop":5437,"lat":51.5356,"lng":-0.062402,"mdsy":-0.0136203,"mdsx":0.377596,"tags":"street camera portrait england man color reflection london hat rain analog rolleiflex pen puddle glasses shoes triptych photographer bokeh voigtlaender streetphotography olympus stranger korea porträt hut korean mann analogue brille schwarzweiss schuhe schwarz voigtländer 25mm ep1 triptychs streetphotographer pfütze triptychon triptychons theblackstar analoglover epl2","color":"#576e87","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6112111134_25ce9f00c5_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7000,"w":70,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6112111134_25ce9f00c5_t.jpg","s":84},{"a":40560,"w":169,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6112111134_25ce9f00c5_m.jpg","s":201},{"a":176000,"w":352,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6112111134_25ce9f00c5.jpg","s":420},{"a":288000,"w":450,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6112111134_25ce9f00c5_z.jpg","s":537},{"a":737280,"w":720,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6112111134_25ce9f00c5_b.jpg","s":859}]},{"id":6112307474,"published":1315139453,"title":"mindjourney","text":"It was a very wise dicision to take pictures to day ... i´m very happy at the moment\n\ninspired by: \nSarah Ann Loreth <a href=\"http://flic.kr/p/8ZTADp\" rel=\"nofollow\">flic.kr/p/8ZTADp</a>\ncatrostu <a href=\"http://flic.kr/p/agiXY8\" rel=\"nofollow\">flic.kr/p/agiXY8</a>\n\nLink to my Facebook page: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Normen-Gadiel-photography/102934056459007\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.facebook.com/pages/Normen-Gadiel-photography/10293405...</a>","author":"Normen Gadiel","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/58172499@N04/6112307474","pop":2040,"lat":52.4701,"lng":11.2049,"mdsy":-0.194145,"mdsx":-0.167353,"tags":"sun inspiration flower men field vintage buch deutschland reading book fly dream feld blumen books bücher fliegen sonnenblumen traumwelt sachsenanhalt mieste","color":"#af8280","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6112307474_45f1ac0663_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7500,"w":100,"h":75,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6112307474_45f1ac0663_t.jpg","s":87},{"a":43200,"w":240,"h":180,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6112307474_45f1ac0663_m.jpg","s":208},{"a":187500,"w":500,"h":375,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6112307474_45f1ac0663.jpg","s":433},{"a":307200,"w":640,"h":480,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6112307474_45f1ac0663_z.jpg","s":554},{"a":786432,"w":1024,"h":768,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6112307474_45f1ac0663_b.jpg","s":887},{"a":3000000,"w":2000,"h":1500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6193/6112307474_213690acdd_o.jpg","s":1732}]},{"id":6114391148,"published":1315178074,"title":"Just a regular night out on the dock","text":"A regular night on the dock.

The city itself is so beautiful and unique but there were simply too many tourists, which makes taking photos quite difficult. Also, Venice is a maze and getting lost in the tiny streets and canals is exciting but can be frustrating at the same time...\n\nAnd one more thing, as I mentioned in my earlier posts that we would maybe see a celebrity - we did!! Salma Hayek with family was walking behind us on Piazza di San Marco and I didn't notice her until I saw a &quot;photographer&quot; with a Nikon D3s and a big Canon. I was about to say wow look at that freak to a friend of mine when that very guy almost threw himself on the floor and started snapping the &quot;piazza&quot; with flash....suddenly it dawned on me that he was a paparazzo and trying to get a snap of the actress. (Salma: &quot;Don't you have enough shots?! Bullshit....&quot;)\n\n&gt;&gt; view on black &lt;&lt;\n\nI left the photo a bit lean on purpose since the even version doesn't look so good in my opinion...\nAnd what's this recent explore madness, almost all the photos I've posted last week entered explore :O not that I would object!\n\n*explore #26*","author":"marin.tomic","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/25767209@N02/6113489291","pop":887,"lat":45.4325,"lng":12.3336,"mdsy":-0.0296476,"mdsx":-0.125676,"tags":"city travel italien venice italy water boat canal nikon europe italia romantic gondola walls venezia narrow venedig veneto gondoliere d40","color":"#695445","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6113489291_620d5401b7_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6113489291_620d5401b7_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6113489291_620d5401b7_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6113489291_620d5401b7.jpg","s":408},{"a":272640,"w":640,"h":426,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6113489291_620d5401b7_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":697344,"w":1024,"h":681,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6082/6113489291_620d5401b7_b.jpg","s":835}]},{"id":6113050854,"published":1315153754,"title":"Macro Art","text":"<b> Explore Front Page  05.

interesting.\n\n25 second exposure using Lee 0.9 + 0.6 (reversed) ND grad filters.\n\nThanks for any comments you may wish to leave.\n","author":"Sunset

We drove up to Savage River, which was about the 15 mile mark.  Only buses or vehicles with special permit were allowed to go any further.  With a 4 year old and 9 month old, the bus trip was not an option.\n\nBraving the harsh winds and constant drizzle we took the 2 mile trail by the river.  Though the sights were beautiful, we couldn't blame the wildlife for remaining hidden in shelter.  Slightly disappointed we headed back to the inn.\n\nThe following morning while the family were in dreamland I headed back.  I really began to appreciate these magnificent animals after Gary got me close to them in Anchorage.  I had to see them in Denali before I left.\n\nIt wasn't until I was heading back that I finally caught sight of them.  They were traveling quickly through the foliage and I had just enough time to get a few shots off before they darted through the trees.  I wish I could have had a bit more time with them, but thankful I was for the few moments I had.","author":"Tenryuu","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23086430@N08/6114372935","pop":280,"lat":63.7159,"lng":-149.005,"mdsy":-0.156683,"mdsx":-0.23474,"tags":"alaska cow moose explore denali calf denalinationalpark explored specanimal","color":"#a66d64","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6199/6114372935_60faeac0cb_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6199/6114372935_60faeac0cb_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6199/6114372935_60faeac0cb_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6199/6114372935_60faeac0cb.jpg","s":408},{"a":272640,"w":640,"h":426,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6199/6114372935_60faeac0cb_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":698368,"w":1024,"h":682,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6199/6114372935_60faeac0cb_b.jpg","s":836}]},{"id":6112938894,"published":1315151808,"title":"Lofoten Islands, Henningsvaer (Sep 4, 2011 #50 on Explore)","text":"Le isole Lofoten sono un arcipelago della Norvegia che si estende a Nord-est tra le contee di Nordland e Troms.

It is usually closed off but access was arranged as part of Photocamp. I think this yard was my favourite part of the museum (photographically speaking).  \n\nIt did take a while to get this shot though since, with 15 or so photographers, there was always one in shot, clambering about. \n\nUnfortunately the weather wasn't great, the sky was cloudy, but not sufficiently dark to make a really good backdrop. When the sun did come out late in the day it was only for about ten minutes and there wasn't time to make the most of it. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to go back there soon, and get access to the yard.","author":"Andrew Rickmann","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73204526@N00/6112908593","pop":91,"lat":53.803,"lng":-1.58456,"mdsy":-0.0287547,"mdsx":-0.222319,"tags":"train rust leeds hdr photocamp armleymills rustinpieces exposureleeds","color":"#806346","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6112908593_34a77176fa_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6112908593_34a77176fa_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6112908593_34a77176fa_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6112908593_34a77176fa.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6112908593_34a77176fa_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6112908593_34a77176fa_b.jpg","s":836}]},{"id":6112546461,"published":1315154432,"title":"The Road to Heaven","text":"I remember feeling so incredibly happy on this day!

During this fantastic one, I was around City Hall viewing a photography exhibition, when this amazing sunset almost came out of nowhere. I stayed around for hours, getting various scenes through all the phases of light and colour. It started off quite <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/6027457414/\">pink</a>, then the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/5986370132/\">blue hour</a> was truly blue, especially where Tower Bridge was concerned. As the light started to die, the sky took on a magical <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/5979713618/\">lavender quality</a> to it.\n\nIt was one of the best sunsets I have ever seen and an added bonus that I had my camera and tripod. To all the photographers out there, let this be a lesson to you; always stick around shooting, as the light can differ quite suddenly and completely change the whole scene. I saw a recent sunset in Paris that almost rivalled this, so I might post one of those shots up later this week.\n\nThis photo has been one of my desktop wallpapers for quite a while now, but I feel it's time to share it with the world.

È stata abitata nel corso dei secoli da Fenici, Cartaginesi, Greci, Italici, Romani, Arabi, Normanni. Sull'isolotto di Formica esiste ancora una vecchia tonnara con i resti di due antichi edifici. Inoltre vi si trova una costruzione fortificata, su cui è costruito un faro.\nL'isola possiede un piccolo porto adatto solo a diporti o piccole barche; su di essa è inoltre presente un museo che custodisce anfore e un'antica barca, utilizzata per la mattanza, perfettamente conservata. Vi è situata anche un'antica chiesa dove i pescatori e gli abitanti si recavano a pregare.\nDi proprietà privata, oggi è sede di una comunità terapeutica per tossicodipendenti &quot;Mondo X&quot;, fondata da Padre Eligio.

This is one of the rifle ports of the caponier at Fort McClary in southern Maine. While Fort McClary never saw battle, if it had been attacked, this is one of the spots through which defenders would have fired their guns. This portion of the fort is underground, with rifle ports facing south, east, and to the north.\n\nIt's not the perfect architectural shot, but it represents a good push from the standpoint that I learned a lot in this attempt. The next time I'm shooting for rays of light, I will plan differently for the shot (in particular how I catch the light AND the time of day).

To find out more about the project and see pictures taken by other photographers go to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/100strangers/\">www.flickr.com/groups/100strangers/</a>.\n\nStranger #60 wasn't happy with the idea of sharing his real name, so he named himself 'Franz'.\n\nI wouldn't have gotten Franz' picture, wasn't it for the support of my friend. \nAfter finding a setting in a mall, we were looking for the perfect stranger to pose there. Leaning on the balustrade of the first floor, under the glass roof I wanted to incorporate, my friend spotted Franz going down the escalator from ground floor to basement. He was perfect for the shot! \nWe started waving and shouting to attract his attention, which I would have never dared, had I been on my own. When we started running down the two escalators, he finally stopped to see what the crazy women wanted from him.\n\nWith his aloof air Franz is one of the people I'd bet, before asking, will decline to take part. Lesson learned in this project: Ask anyway!\n \nI got a vibe that he wasn't too keen on being asked personal stuff. What really impressed me with him, was his huge patience in supporting me to get exactly the image I wanted. I had to take many shots to get one with the right light, the right expression, all with him being centered under the glass roof. He assured me several times it was okay to go on until I had the planned result.\n\nOnly recently have I found the confidence to come up with a vision for a picture like that, share it with the stranger and follow through. I really enjoy the new creative freedom.\nI played with a very open aperture and a golden reflector here. \n","author":"Zwieselchen","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/27246478@N05/6116939546","pop":320,"lat":50.9381,"lng":7.0025,"mdsy":-0.078061,"mdsx":-0.220488,"tags":"","color":"#917057","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6116939546_5745c474bf_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6800,"w":68,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6116939546_5745c474bf_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38880,"w":162,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6116939546_5745c474bf_m.jpg","s":197},{"a":169000,"w":338,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6116939546_5745c474bf.jpg","s":411},{"a":277120,"w":433,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6116939546_5745c474bf_z.jpg","s":526},{"a":709632,"w":693,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6116939546_5745c474bf_b.jpg","s":842}]},{"id":6116286074,"published":1315229679,"title":"memoir","text":"<a href=\"http://flickr2.netbits.co.uk/large/photo/b/6116286074\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View Large</b></a> | <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/millanprible/sets/72157612266975939/\"><b>Cosmopolitan Hong Kong Set</b></a> | <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/millanprible/sets/72157622488648966/\"><b>Streets, Strangers Set</b></a> \n\n-<a href=\"http://millanprible.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Blog</b></a>","author":"millan p. rible","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23852850@N04/6116286074","pop":538,"lat":22.2818,"lng":114.158,"mdsy":-0.22998,"mdsx":-0.0582184,"tags":"memoir","color":"#ada397","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6116286074_3ea4ca69cd_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":8600,"w":100,"h":86,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6116286074_3ea4ca69cd_t.jpg","s":93},{"a":49440,"w":240,"h":206,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6116286074_3ea4ca69cd_m.jpg","s":222},{"a":214500,"w":500,"h":429,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6116286074_3ea4ca69cd.jpg","s":463},{"a":351360,"w":640,"h":549,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6116286074_3ea4ca69cd_z.jpg","s":593},{"a":899072,"w":1024,"h":878,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6116286074_3ea4ca69cd_b.jpg","s":948}]},{"id":6117010105,"published":1315251451,"title":"Superwoman en los 50","text":"Para el proyecto &quot;Décadas FS&quot;\nModelos: Olga G.

The last trip in April was an experience, but this time around I got more than I expected. First, our crew was a dozen people as compared to my last trip of four. We actually took the boat on the lake, instead of leaving it docked. The water was a good 60-70 ft higher, give or take, exposing a whole new playground. 90-100 degree weather, warm water, slot hikes, surfing, grilling, fireworks. . .it was awesome.\n\nOriginally we were staying Tuesday night to Sunday, but a few of us without children decided to stay the extra day. With a crew of five left we explored Navajo Canyon in the wakeboat, and got treated to a beautiful evening. We had the boat cut screwing around with some other things when I saw this scene. There was no light on these rocks at first, but within a second it opened and I took the shot. Clouds, bold colors, reflections, and a unique view you may never have again made this my favorite shot and worth the trip. \n\nPowell is an oasis, and after having the experience to explore a different aspect to the region twice this year has been amazing. Now for a winter trip.\n\n<b>Any Critique/Advice is Much Appreciated.</b>\n\nLee ND 0.9 S. Grad.

MARY THE VIRGIN, High Halden, Kent","text":"High Halden is found midway between Ashford and Tenterden, and although Wealden in character rather than one of the Romney Marsh villages, it is actually situated between the two.  Having been at one time on the edge of the old Wealden forest, it has been inhabited for many years.  Apparently Tiffenden Manor, south of the village green, claims to have been farmed continuously for over a thousand years.\n\nA legacy of the villages’ wealden days has bestowed its parish church with an amazing feature – the extraordinary porch and belfry tower.  The porch has stood here for nigh on 700 years, the walls made of upright timbers 10 feet high, and supporting a roof of red tiles which rise to a shingled tower and spire.  The south porch, added in the 14th century, has some more remarkable timbers, two halves of an upturned tree forming the arch.  In total, there are some 50 tons of timbers in the porches.\n\nInside the church, and around the columns, can be found some quaint old seats of Kentish marble, and in the sanctuary is a gem of Elizabethan craftsmanship, a cup dated to 1562.  The font dates back to the 12th century, and there are traces of Norman work in the walls of the nave, and in an old bit of window are the arms of John of Gaunt, suggesting that there may be some truth in the legend that he once had a palace here.\n\nThe village has been linked with some of the famous smuggling families in this area, most notably the Ransleys, who were leaders of the infamous 18th and 19th century Hawkhurst and Aldington gangs.  George Ransley was originally a farmer, but having prospered as a smuggler he built an inn called the Bourne Tap at Aldington and became an innkeeper as well as continuing his smuggling activities.\n\nPentax P30T\nFuji Superia Reala 100 (rated @ ISO80)\nPentax-A 28-80mm lens","author":"Ian Dalton1 (Thanks!...75,000 views)","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/51702306@N03/6116750712","pop":37,"lat":51.1031,"lng":0.714282,"mdsy":0.0521473,"mdsx":0.426885,"tags":"photo kent stmarythevirgin pentaxp30t medievalchurches highhalden","color":"#447a90","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6116750712_3afd05873e_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6900,"w":100,"h":69,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6116750712_3afd05873e_t.jpg","s":83},{"a":39840,"w":240,"h":166,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6116750712_3afd05873e_m.jpg","s":200},{"a":173500,"w":500,"h":347,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6116750712_3afd05873e.jpg","s":417},{"a":284160,"w":640,"h":444,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6116750712_3afd05873e_z.jpg","s":533},{"a":727040,"w":1024,"h":710,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6116750712_3afd05873e_b.jpg","s":853}]},{"id":6119526992,"published":1315288529,"title":"LanguageLess","text":"","author":"Samhlaíocht Aonair","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/88944471@N00/6119526992","pop":28,"lat":34.0216,"lng":-118.396,"mdsy":-0.328599,"mdsx":0.247434,"tags":"sooc lightreflectingcommunication","color":"#c1c3c5","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119526992_c32154eff5_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7500,"w":75,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119526992_c32154eff5_t.jpg","s":87},{"a":43200,"w":180,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119526992_c32154eff5_m.jpg","s":208},{"a":187500,"w":375,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119526992_c32154eff5.jpg","s":433},{"a":307200,"w":480,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119526992_c32154eff5_z.jpg","s":554},{"a":786432,"w":768,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119526992_c32154eff5_b.jpg","s":887}]},{"id":6117153976,"published":1315245062,"title":"Lamborghini Murciélago Murcielago 670-R SV -EXPLORED-","text":"","author":"Raphaël Belly","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/50105406@N02/6117153976","pop":213,"lat":43.2539,"lng":5.78748,"mdsy":-0.100253,"mdsx":-0.288587,"tags":"world test cars car race start paul grid photography eos championship high flickr track photographie tech explorer picture competition automotive du racing course explore belly lap exotic 7d passion gt raphael circuit lamborghini nicky rb fia sv ricard motorsport dominik starting supercars murciélago murcielago laps gt3 raphaël httt castellet 2011 gt1 schwager pastorelli explored munnich allinkl 670r","color":"#9d4b47","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117153976_dd124896df_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117153976_dd124896df_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117153976_dd124896df_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117153976_dd124896df.jpg","s":408},{"a":272640,"w":640,"h":426,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117153976_dd124896df_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":698368,"w":1024,"h":682,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117153976_dd124896df_b.jpg","s":836},{"a":1091840,"w":1280,"h":853,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6200/6117153976_bdd1027635_o.jpg","s":1045}]},{"id":6116906970,"published":1315241070,"title":"A Celtic Sky","text":"St Tudno's Churchyard, Llandudno, North Wales 2011.

Now, excuse me while I curl up on the sofa with a mug of hot chocolate and my doggie.","author":"Jeannie.H","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/22258880@N07/6117803628","pop":29,"lat":56.0089,"lng":-4.7623,"mdsy":-0.222677,"mdsx":-0.316761,"tags":"park play swing 050911 kidstonpark hpad","color":"#9db065","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6117803628_4f8117489c_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6600,"w":100,"h":66,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6117803628_4f8117489c_t.jpg","s":81},{"a":38160,"w":240,"h":159,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6117803628_4f8117489c_m.jpg","s":195},{"a":166000,"w":500,"h":332,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6117803628_4f8117489c.jpg","s":407},{"a":272000,"w":640,"h":425,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6117803628_4f8117489c_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":696320,"w":1024,"h":680,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6201/6117803628_4f8117489c_b.jpg","s":834}]},{"id":6116481978,"published":1315233670,"title":"Head for the Hills","text":"30 minutes out of Denver and the Friday mass exodus to the mountains is underway.. a TTW by Mar....best in the light box","author":"Camelot5","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/45577491@N08/6116481978","pop":89,"lat":39.7114,"lng":-105.385,"mdsy":-0.0837409,"mdsx":0.40988,"tags":"mountains clouds colorado","color":"#648aa0","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6065/6116481978_2f09e29119_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6065/6116481978_2f09e29119_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38640,"w":240,"h":161,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6065/6116481978_2f09e29119_m.jpg","s":197},{"a":167000,"w":500,"h":334,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6065/6116481978_2f09e29119.jpg","s":409},{"a":273920,"w":640,"h":428,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6065/6116481978_2f09e29119_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":701440,"w":1024,"h":685,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6065/6116481978_2f09e29119_b.jpg","s":838}]},{"id":6115217481,"published":1315214635,"title":"[ Explore ] Hey !!

It is located near the Lemonthyme lodge just north of Cradle Mountain National Park. After a 45 minute walk along some trails that were pretty boggy at the time, this waterfall and Champagne falls were flowing briskly. There were too many shadows to used a very dense ND filter to good effect but with a 2 stop ND and GND held diagonally across the image, the light was manageable. The main difference between most waterfalls and icelandic waterfalls is that in Iceland, there are no trees! Hence the waterfalls tend to look more open and vast - taking nothing away from falls like this though.\n\n<a href=\"http://dee-t.deviantart.com/gallery/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[Deviant Art Gallery]</a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/everlookphotography\" rel=\"nofollow\">[Facebook]</a> <a href=\"http://www.everlookphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[Web Gallery]</a>","author":"Dylan Toh (baby delivered!)","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/9619621@N02/6117317897","pop":451,"lat":-41.5353,"lng":146.104,"mdsy":-0.041388,"mdsx":-0.247372,"tags":"forest river landscape photography waterfall tasmania dee bridalveil everlook lemonthymelodge","color":"#8a704b","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6117317897_9e6ef2c66c_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6117317897_9e6ef2c66c_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38640,"w":240,"h":161,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6117317897_9e6ef2c66c_m.jpg","s":197},{"a":168000,"w":500,"h":336,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6117317897_9e6ef2c66c.jpg","s":410},{"a":275840,"w":640,"h":431,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6117317897_9e6ef2c66c_z.jpg","s":525},{"a":705536,"w":1024,"h":689,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6117317897_9e6ef2c66c_b.jpg","s":840}]},{"id":6116987849,"published":1315251108,"title":"Cap Gris-Nez, France - IX","text":"I almost threw this picture but I finally decided to do something with it...\n<a href=\"http://www.dherreman.com/cap-gris-nez-france-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dherreman.com/cap-gris-nez-france-9</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dherreman.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dherreman.com</a> | <a href=\"http://500px.com/davidh\" rel=\"nofollow\">500px.com</a> | <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/113438256900303213931\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google+</a>\n\n<i>Please don't use this image on websites, blogs or other media without my explicit permission.

We were at a cabin deep in a doug-fir forest, and I knew the starlight was beaming bright further up the hill in the meadows.  So, off I rode into the night.  \n\nWithout any light pollution or moon, there was zero chance of getting light on the trees at the base of the photo... even with a very long single exposure.  And without a clear view of the North Star, I decided to compose a shot of the Milky Way, but without the need for a lighted foreground.  I wanted to make sure to get both some doug-fir and some oak silhouettes in the shot, so I took my time and did some test exposures to make sure I had what I wanted in the frame.  I also decided to try out some shorter exposures, so that I could create a time-lapse video in addition to a still photo (at 24fps, you need quite a few shots).\n\nThis is the result of 311 individual 30-second exposures, stacked in Photoshop, to create over 2.5 hours of the Milky Way moving across the sky.  \n\nCanon 5D Mark II\nCanon 17-40L @17mm\n311 individual 30-second exposures @ F4\nNo filters\nISO 1250","author":"Ivan Sohrakoff","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/9678127@N02/6118846084","pop":174,"lat":40.5855,"lng":-123.674,"mdsy":-0.0399674,"mdsx":-0.0711791,"tags":"longexposure nightphotography trees stars timelapse oak nightscape meadow galaxy astrophotography humboldtcounty startrails milkyway starlight douglasfir startrail milkywaygalaxy ivansohrakoff ivansohrakoffphotographic isophotographic californianightscape northamericanstartrails","color":"#615548","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6118846084_cff94e9c15_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6118846084_cff94e9c15_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6118846084_cff94e9c15_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":167000,"w":500,"h":334,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6118846084_cff94e9c15.jpg","s":409},{"a":273920,"w":640,"h":428,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6118846084_cff94e9c15_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":700416,"w":1024,"h":684,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6118846084_cff94e9c15_b.jpg","s":837}]},{"id":6117787535,"published":1315264205,"title":"Eclipse Male Wood Duck  Explore at #497 on Fluidr","text":"CLICK ON IMAGE TO VIEW LARGE\nWe went to North Chagrin Reservation in hopes of shooting some woodies. We found that all of them were in eclipse. Shortly after breeding, males begin to molt into &quot;eclipse&quot; plumage, a trait that Wood Ducks share with most other North American ducks.

And as I said in yesterday's photo, keep shooting once you're there, as you'll never know what photo will be the magic one.\n\nThis week I have given you a Paris shot and a sunset shot, so I figured why not give you a sunset in Paris shot. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/6071075623/\">Again</a>. I ended up being behind schedule to get to the Arc de Triomphe and I could see the sunset was developing into something quite nice. I left Anna behind and practically ran up the Avenue des Champs-Élysées. I then had to queue to get up to the top of the Arc. Needless to say I was quite anxious. On the way in I was told I wasn't allowed to use my tripod. \n\nWhen I got to the top, everyone was viewing the Eiffel Tower and not paying much attention to the sunset over La Défense. I started snapping away up here for about 15 minutes. I chose the shot that just had the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/6006636405/\">sun peeking through</a>.

Highest Position Explore #16 September 6,2011. Thank You!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.davidrironsjrphotography.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.davidrironsjrphotography.com</a>\n\n I hope everyone enjoyed the long weekend, here in the United States. Summer has finally arrived in the Pacific Northwest. Decided to take a trip up for sunrise last Monday to Mt Rainier, as I had trouble sleeping! I have not, like many here in the Pacific Northwest, had my fix of the wildflowers this year as they are late to the blooming party!\n\n So I arrived at the Sunrise visitor center on Mt Rainier and started to hike up to a field loaded with lupine. I bumped into fellow Flickr friend Aaron Eakin <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaron_eakin/\">www.flickr.com/photos/aaron_eakin/</a> who wound up car camping the previous night! Hoping for an epic light show, we were disappointed that there were no clouds in the sky, except for the lone cloud behind Mt Rainier. This is the second time I have been to Sunrise, but need to plan for more time to hike around it's trails. This area is the highest point in the park that you can drive to, over 6,400 in elevation!  Paradise is at an elevation of about 5,400 feet. \n\n This is a combination of three exposures (-2,0,+2) merged and tonemapped in Photomatix. I cropped in Photoshop, and did some &quot;Dodging and Burning&quot; as well. I ran through Lightroom and upped the contrast just a bit and pulled back the oranges.\n\n  Thank you for your views, comments and faves. I appreciate them. In other news, I just received my copy of the &quot;Washington State Magazine&quot; Fall 2011 issue. This is the magazine put out by the Washington State University located in Pullman, Washington. I am now finally &quot;Print Published.&quot; They contacted me to license a photo for a piece they were doing on the Admiralty Head Lighthouse. The article is located on the last page of the magazine and here is the picture that they used: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fresnatic/5688721952/\">www.flickr.com/photos/fresnatic/5688721952/</a> I hope everyone has a great week ahead! \n\n Please do not use my images on blogs or websites without my permission.

The view is absolutely incredible there!\n\nAbout the picture:\n\nObviously you could not shoot a bird in motion at 1 second. However this bird was shot from the deck at twilight as it flew by. The scene was also shot from the deck and was colorful but I have enhanced it with NIK software. I then copied the Great Blue Heron and pasted it into the frame. Yes, it is a composite image. However, you could see this exact scene almost any time you were on their deck. There were tons of Great Blue Heron flying by all day.","author":"Arlo West","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/53797814@N07/6120299488","pop":810,"lat":45.1187,"lng":-66.3679,"mdsy":-0.0146788,"mdsx":-0.438268,"tags":"new blue canada heron harbour great brunswick chance gbh","color":"#a32c14","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6120299488_a847a21041_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":5600,"w":100,"h":56,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6120299488_a847a21041_t.jpg","s":75},{"a":32400,"w":240,"h":135,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6120299488_a847a21041_m.jpg","s":180},{"a":140500,"w":500,"h":281,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6120299488_a847a21041.jpg","s":375},{"a":230400,"w":640,"h":360,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6120299488_a847a21041_z.jpg","s":480},{"a":589824,"w":1024,"h":576,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6120299488_a847a21041_b.jpg","s":768}]},{"id":6119406799,"published":1315303443,"title":"Parascender over Low Man","text":"Not a bad way to spend an evening...\n\n<a href=\"http://www.benivoryphotography.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben Ivory Photography</a>","author":"Ben Ivory","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23223602@N03/6119406799","pop":1290,"lat":50.5805,"lng":-3.73788,"mdsy":-0.108792,"mdsx":-0.126908,"tags":"sunset man low devon tor moor dartmoor parascending haytor parascender","color":"#907c62","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6119406799_16892dd56b_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6119406799_16892dd56b_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6119406799_16892dd56b_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6119406799_16892dd56b.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6119406799_16892dd56b_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6119406799_16892dd56b_b.jpg","s":836}]},{"id":6122938330,"published":1315369168,"title":"Mount Edith Cavell, Jasper National Park","text":"I've been holding this one back. It's my favorite picture from my trip to Canada. This is Mount Cavell in Jasper National Park. \n\nOne of the great things about the mountains in Banff and Jasper is how accessible the mountains and the backcountry are. Nowhere is this more true than at Mt. Edith Cavell. It's a relatively short walk up to this viewpoint. another half mile and you get to an iceberg filled lake with a glacier down to the water. \n\nWe were there for sunrise and had the place completely to ourselves...which stil amazes me. It really is the best thing about this photography thing. I love getting out and seeing incredible things without interruptions.","author":"Millron","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/18605140@N00/6122938330","pop":518,"lat":52.6841,"lng":-118.056,"mdsy":0.101579,"mdsx":0.389983,"tags":"canada rockies nationalpark jasper canadian glacier banff","color":"#3e5377","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6122938330_054cc986aa_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":10000,"w":100,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6122938330_054cc986aa_t.jpg","s":100},{"a":57600,"w":240,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6122938330_054cc986aa_m.jpg","s":240},{"a":250000,"w":500,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6122938330_054cc986aa.jpg","s":500},{"a":409600,"w":640,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6122938330_054cc986aa_z.jpg","s":640},{"a":1048576,"w":1024,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6122938330_054cc986aa_b.jpg","s":1024},{"a":2250000,"w":1500,"h":1500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6189/6122938330_f112e966f4_o.jpg","s":1500}]},{"id":6119860247,"published":1315316411,"title":"?????? ???? ? ??????? ????","text":" Rimed winter oak  forest\n Russia","author":"Tatters:)","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/62938898@N00/6119860247","pop":335,"lat":51.5507,"lng":45.9593,"mdsy":-0.0018451,"mdsx":0.438979,"tags":"trees winter snow forest oak frost russia hoarfrost explore myfavourite ???? colorphotoaward rimedsnow","color":"#536492","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6119860247_a30a380478_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6900,"w":69,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6119860247_a30a380478_t.jpg","s":83},{"a":39600,"w":165,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6119860247_a30a380478_m.jpg","s":199},{"a":171500,"w":343,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6119860247_a30a380478.jpg","s":414},{"a":280960,"w":439,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6119860247_a30a380478_z.jpg","s":530},{"a":640458,"w":663,"h":966,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6182/6119860247_a30a380478_b.jpg","s":800}]},{"id":6121567105,"published":1315349563,"title":"17 mile drive","text":"photopainting-  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/davelsworld/6121567105/sizes/o/in/photostream/\">www.flickr.com/photos/davelsworld/6121567105/sizes/o/in/p...</a>\npacific grove, calif.\ncarmel calif.","author":"Sunnyvaledave","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/99352947@N00/6121567105","pop":621,"lat":36.5823,"lng":-121.968,"mdsy":-0.235148,"mdsx":0.48501,"tags":"17miledrive carmelcalif pacificgrovecalif","color":"#71a1cc","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6121567105_4fa876106a_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7300,"w":100,"h":73,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6121567105_4fa876106a_t.jpg","s":85},{"a":41760,"w":240,"h":174,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6121567105_4fa876106a_m.jpg","s":204},{"a":181500,"w":500,"h":363,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6121567105_4fa876106a.jpg","s":426},{"a":296960,"w":640,"h":464,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6121567105_4fa876106a_z.jpg","s":545},{"a":760832,"w":1024,"h":743,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6121567105_4fa876106a_b.jpg","s":872},{"a":4576864,"w":2512,"h":1822,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6121567105_eb3405977d_o.jpg","s":2139}]},{"id":6120225087,"published":1315323585,"title":"challenge...fluffy","text":"Explore#29","author":"thrunance'seyes","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/45708854@N07/6120225087","pop":464,"lat":40.4335,"lng":-74.9803,"mdsy":-0.26352,"mdsx":-0.188958,"tags":"ourdailychallenge","color":"#a3a86d","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6120225087_4cf09d1074_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6400,"w":100,"h":64,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6120225087_4cf09d1074_t.jpg","s":80},{"a":36720,"w":240,"h":153,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6120225087_4cf09d1074_m.jpg","s":192},{"a":159000,"w":500,"h":318,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6120225087_4cf09d1074.jpg","s":399},{"a":260480,"w":640,"h":407,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6120225087_4cf09d1074_z.jpg","s":510},{"a":666624,"w":1024,"h":651,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6064/6120225087_4cf09d1074_b.jpg","s":816}]},{"id":6120489196,"published":1315318237,"title":"La nebbia si disolve al far della sera... / In the evening the fog vanishes...

So, one nice evening I took the Mamiya out with me and took some photographs of St. Joseph Island.\n\nThis island is the third largest freshwater island in the world (nearby Manitoulin Island is the largest, and Isle Royale in Lake Superior is second).\n\nThis is Highway 548 that circles the island.  There are mostly dairy farms and maple syrup forests here.  It is quite rural.  You can see a piece of the lake in the distance.</i>","author":"La Bran?aro","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/26495293@N05/6121867661","pop":337,"lat":46.2789,"lng":-84.0731,"mdsy":-0.212621,"mdsx":-0.207414,"tags":"sunset ontario canada 120 mamiya film mediumformat evening 645 scenery kodak farm farmland fields hay goldenhour northernontario ektar hayfields stmarysriver ruralontario mamiyasekor 80mmf28 m645 stjosephisland ruralcanada","color":"#9f9165","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6121867661_5fc3cfd2d3_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7300,"w":100,"h":73,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6121867661_5fc3cfd2d3_t.jpg","s":85},{"a":42240,"w":240,"h":176,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6121867661_5fc3cfd2d3_m.jpg","s":206},{"a":183000,"w":500,"h":366,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6121867661_5fc3cfd2d3.jpg","s":428},{"a":300160,"w":640,"h":469,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6121867661_5fc3cfd2d3_z.jpg","s":548},{"a":768000,"w":1024,"h":750,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6121867661_5fc3cfd2d3_b.jpg","s":876},{"a":1431552,"w":1398,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6087/6121867661_10a967310a_o.jpg","s":1196}]},{"id":6120376839,"published":1315326390,"title":"482- Paris","text":"Immeubles Hausmannien et quais de Seine.\n\nAppareil: Panasonic Lumix FZ38\nTraitement: HDR\nDate de prise de vue: août 2011.","author":"Huey_Chris","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/45283106@N08/6120376839","pop":305,"lat":48.8631,"lng":2.29668,"mdsy":0.0452526,"mdsx":-0.235697,"tags":"paris france seine river boats artwork frankreich haussmann cityscape view bateaux rivière frankrijk capitale 75 francia vue hdr immeubles fz38","color":"#6d5c32","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6120376839_fae120bd8f_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7800,"w":78,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6120376839_fae120bd8f_t.jpg","s":88},{"a":44880,"w":187,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6120376839_fae120bd8f_m.jpg","s":212},{"a":194500,"w":389,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6120376839_fae120bd8f.jpg","s":441},{"a":318720,"w":498,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6120376839_fae120bd8f_z.jpg","s":565},{"a":816128,"w":797,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6120376839_fae120bd8f_b.jpg","s":903},{"a":15830100,"w":3510,"h":4510,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6120376839_c20045ab61_o.jpg","s":3979}]},{"id":6119306137,"published":1315299795,"title":".","text":"Rome, Italy","author":"Neal Bingham","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/90472820@N00/6119306137","pop":354,"lat":41.8905,"lng":12.4906,"mdsy":-0.166318,"mdsx":-0.085389,"tags":"street italy rome colour nikon palatino segway tamron d90 1750mm touristicos","color":"#978a74","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119306137_de441d3de3_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7100,"w":100,"h":71,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119306137_de441d3de3_t.jpg","s":84},{"a":40800,"w":240,"h":170,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119306137_de441d3de3_m.jpg","s":202},{"a":177000,"w":500,"h":354,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119306137_de441d3de3.jpg","s":421},{"a":289920,"w":640,"h":453,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119306137_de441d3de3_z.jpg","s":538},{"a":741376,"w":1024,"h":724,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6119306137_de441d3de3_b.jpg","s":861}]},{"id":6122643927,"published":1315376949,"title":"Moon Season :x","text":"<i> Non Ps :P\n\n<b>Photo</b> : - Yoo.Kid ?

With the great company of Bob and Val, We watched the sun set, then waited and waited. Then all of a sudden thunder and lightening storms came from all directions. We barely escaped off the dock when a fast storm with hurricane/tornado winds came. If we had waited an extra 20 seconds we would have be stuck on the dock and unable to see our way back due to the heavy downpour and winds.\n\nIt wasn't until we got back in the truck that we realized it was 1:30am and we had been out on the dock since 8:30. But, it was just a regular night for the West's.\n\nThanks Val West and @bob for a great day and adventure.\n— with Val West and Bob West.","author":"Insight Imaging: John A Ryan Photography","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21784565@N04/6125034288","pop":1794,"lat":42.2906,"lng":-81.8733,"mdsy":0.307106,"mdsx":-0.392107,"tags":"","color":"#2d4f82","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6125034288_521411ee22_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":5600,"w":100,"h":56,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6125034288_521411ee22_t.jpg","s":75},{"a":32400,"w":240,"h":135,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6125034288_521411ee22_m.jpg","s":180},{"a":140500,"w":500,"h":281,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6125034288_521411ee22.jpg","s":375},{"a":230400,"w":640,"h":360,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6125034288_521411ee22_z.jpg","s":480},{"a":589824,"w":1024,"h":576,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6125034288_521411ee22_b.jpg","s":768},{"a":9502320,"w":4110,"h":2312,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6125034288_a3670aac01_o.jpg","s":3083}]},{"id":6122864299,"published":1315385120,"title":"The Text is Attitude","text":"Instruction #49 - &quot;Read the street in front of you by saying to yourself everything that you see happening both near you and coming toward you (the text of the street) and the picture will present itself.&quot; - Joel Meyerowitz\n\n\nAnd thanks to Monty May!","author":"pictomentoes","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/50037366@N08/6122864299","pop":1078,"lat":-37.7984,"lng":144.979,"mdsy":-0.0833826,"mdsx":-0.18351,"tags":"brunswickstreet","color":"#7e4e4e","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6122864299_5db41462c7_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7700,"w":100,"h":77,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6122864299_5db41462c7_t.jpg","s":88},{"a":44400,"w":240,"h":185,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6122864299_5db41462c7_m.jpg","s":211},{"a":193000,"w":500,"h":386,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6122864299_5db41462c7.jpg","s":439},{"a":316160,"w":640,"h":494,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6122864299_5db41462c7_z.jpg","s":562},{"a":809984,"w":1024,"h":791,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6122864299_5db41462c7_b.jpg","s":900},{"a":6476115,"w":2895,"h":2237,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6188/6122864299_f722a64f76_o.jpg","s":2545}]},{"id":6123466495,"published":1315404649,"title":"Lantern Festival at Chinese Garden","text":"Photoshoot with Ting Yap.

This is following on from <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/6121666649/\">yesterday's photo</a> which was taken from atop this monument. A friend of mine commented that they loved this place, so I thought why not stick up another photo, this time with the famous arch in it.\n\nInaugurated in 1836, the Arc de Triomphe (Triumphant Arch) was built to honour those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars. The names of all French victories and generals are inscribed around its surfaces. Beneath it lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.\n\nPhotographically it was a very busy day; starting off at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/6074536809/\">La Conciergerie</a> (one of my favourite shots and interiors) and finally ending up late at night at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/6067006021/\">Le Louvre</a>. This shot required quite a bit of masking to get rid of the huge amount of cars that were present at the time. I also would have liked to get a better angle, but I traded that for having the setting sun in the middle of the arch.\n\nI'm off to Norway later today, so I shall not be online much. I'll hopefully post some more photos early next week. This looks much better <a href=\"lightbox/\" rel=\"nofollow\">larger</a>! (Press L)\n\nSomeone was telling me I should sell prints of these. If you happen to want to buy any (thanks Paul!) then you head over to <a href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/thefella\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Bubble</a> and get some there. I believe you can also buy some off <a href=\"http://500px.com/thefella\" rel=\"nofollow\">500px</a>, although I'm not too sure how good they are.

We have another cloudless day here in Seattle as the Summer that wasn't has finally arrived! Looks like a trip to Paradise on Mt Rainer is needed as the wildflowers are supposed to be in their prime now! Good thing as we should start seeing some fall color in a couple of weeks at the higher elevations!\n\n Took this shot back in March the day of the &quot;Super Moon.&quot; Fairly uneventful as the &quot;Super Moon&quot; rose to the right of this image. Oh well! I realized I did not have a &quot;Blue Hour&quot; shot of Seattle in my arsenal, so here it is!\n\n  This is one RAW image SOOC processed in Camera Raw. I adjusted the white balance to cool the image a tad. I sharpened and added a slight vignette in Lightroom.\n\n Thank you for all of your views, comments and faves.

It is the second smallest of the famous Cinque Terre towns frequented by tourists.\n\nManarola may be the oldest of the towns in the Cinque Terre, with the cornerstone of the church, San Lorenzo, dating from 1338. The local dialect is Manarolese, which is marginally different from the dialects in the nearby area. The name &quot;Manarola&quot; is probably dialectical evolution of the Latin, &quot;magna rota&quot;. In the Manarolese dialect this was changed to &quot;magna roea&quot; which means &quot;large wheel&quot;, in reference to the mill wheel in the town [1].\nManarola's primary industries have traditionally been fishing and wine-making. The local wine, called Sciacchetrà, is especially renowned; references from Roman writings mention the high quality of the wine produced in the region. In recent years, Manarola and its neighboring towns have become popular tourist destinations, particularly in the summer months. Tourist attractions in the region include a famous walking trail between Manarola and Riomaggiore (called Via dell'Amore, &quot;Love's Trail&quot;) and hiking trails in the hills and vineyards above the town. Manarola is one of the five villages. Mostly all of the houses are bright and colourful.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jekaworldphotography.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit our Website\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jeka-World-Photography/120037331355891?sk=wall/\">Follow us on Facebook</a></a>","author":"Jeka World Photography","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48426512@N07/6125413170","pop":386,"lat":44.1072,"lng":9.72633,"mdsy":-0.0843285,"mdsx":-0.122605,"tags":"world travel houses vacation people italy holiday art rock landscape boats photography fishing italian colorful europe liguria coastal cinqueterre manarola riomaggiore laspezia jeka jeffrose italianriveria frazione jekaworldphotography kalitharose jeffrosephotography","color":"#745854","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6125413170_ce799df847_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6125413170_ce799df847_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38640,"w":240,"h":161,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6125413170_ce799df847_m.jpg","s":197},{"a":167000,"w":500,"h":334,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6125413170_ce799df847.jpg","s":409},{"a":273920,"w":640,"h":428,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6125413170_ce799df847_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":701440,"w":1024,"h":685,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6125413170_ce799df847_b.jpg","s":838},{"a":10036224,"w":3872,"h":2592,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6186/6125413170_0af42a3930_o.jpg","s":3168}]},{"id":6123738071,"published":1315410338,"title":"Tarde de agosto en La Bota","text":"Playa de La Bota, Huelva.\n\nEXPLORE 7/9/2011\n\nPlease don't use this image without my explicit permission. © All rights reserved \nPor favor, no uses esta imagen sin mi permiso explícito.

I took a walk along the beach.\nHere you will see such things as periwinkles, barnacles, seaweed, sandstone rock formations carved by the tide.\n\nThis is the beach where I spent the summers while I was growing up.  The tides here are the highest in the world.  The vertical distance between low and high tide is the height of a 4 story building.  It has been estimated that the water flowing into the Basin 2x per day is more than all the rivers in the world running for 24 hours.\n\nThe shot of my foot in the mud gives you some idea of how deep the mud is when you go out farther towards the low tide mark.  When there is a little bit of water covering the mud, you can go &quot;mud skating&quot; - much like ice skating, but in your bare feet.  I remember the first time when I took Suzanne out on the mud flats she thought it was really cool.\n\nThere are small aquatic animals in the mud that the Semipalmated Sandpipers feed on every summer when they stop to refuel on their way from the Arctic back to South America.","author":"Trevdog67","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/26030733@N02/6119442463","pop":138,"lat":45.1379,"lng":-64.3168,"mdsy":-0.23092,"mdsx":0.315762,"tags":"seaweed novascotia tide wolfville periwinkle bayoffundy intertidalzone annapolisvalley barnacle grandpre minasbasin evangelinebeach southernbight","color":"#959ba7","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6119442463_4f7ed3825f_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6119442463_4f7ed3825f_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6119442463_4f7ed3825f_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6119442463_4f7ed3825f.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6119442463_4f7ed3825f_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":345600,"w":720,"h":480,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6062/6119442463_4f7ed3825f_b.jpg","s":588}]},{"id":6120934323,"published":1315337248,"title":"","text":"","author":"Kristin Magnusd","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/42511372@N06/6120934323","pop":54,"lat":64.0899,"lng":-21.9039,"mdsy":-0.134829,"mdsx":0.405007,"tags":"autumn olympus haust e510 2011 kriam","color":"#7288a5","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6120934323_f7272784c0_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7500,"w":100,"h":75,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6120934323_f7272784c0_t.jpg","s":87},{"a":42960,"w":240,"h":179,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6120934323_f7272784c0_m.jpg","s":207},{"a":186500,"w":500,"h":373,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6120934323_f7272784c0.jpg","s":432},{"a":305920,"w":640,"h":478,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6120934323_f7272784c0_z.jpg","s":553},{"a":782336,"w":1024,"h":764,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6120934323_f7272784c0_b.jpg","s":884},{"a":7800408,"w":3234,"h":2412,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6120934323_2f503cd06d_o.jpg","s":2793}]},{"id":6122341718,"published":1315355171,"title":"Hub Of Activity [Explored]","text":"","author":"Yogi.Arora","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/56709190@N08/6122341718","pop":112,"lat":40.7559,"lng":-73.9863,"mdsy":-0.0432667,"mdsx":-0.21295,"tags":"","color":"#794941","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6122341718_6f84cc70ae_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6600,"w":100,"h":66,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6122341718_6f84cc70ae_t.jpg","s":81},{"a":37920,"w":240,"h":158,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6122341718_6f84cc70ae_m.jpg","s":195},{"a":165000,"w":500,"h":330,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6122341718_6f84cc70ae.jpg","s":406},{"a":270720,"w":640,"h":423,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6122341718_6f84cc70ae_z.jpg","s":520},{"a":692224,"w":1024,"h":676,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6122341718_6f84cc70ae_b.jpg","s":832},{"a":16687932,"w":5028,"h":3319,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6198/6122341718_dcc7355ff1_o.jpg","s":4085}]},{"id":6120822040,"published":1315324543,"title":"Pink","text":"herbst Anemone\nExplore: Highest position: 349 on Wednesday, September 7, 2011\n\n\n \n","author":"Django_Leinfelden","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/13363423@N05/6120822040","pop":58,"lat":48.7029,"lng":9.13685,"mdsy":-0.0463371,"mdsx":0.629572,"tags":"pink garden blumen garten anemonen fiorifleursflores","color":"#b659a0","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6120822040_58d5dbc62f_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":8500,"w":85,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6120822040_58d5dbc62f_t.jpg","s":92},{"a":48960,"w":204,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6120822040_58d5dbc62f_m.jpg","s":221},{"a":212000,"w":424,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6120822040_58d5dbc62f.jpg","s":460},{"a":347520,"w":543,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6120822040_58d5dbc62f_z.jpg","s":590},{"a":889856,"w":869,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6209/6120822040_58d5dbc62f_b.jpg","s":943}]},{"id":6120325346,"published":1315314648,"title":"06/30 Lo que me hace llorar.

It located in the Shevaroys range of hills in the Eastern Ghats; the Yercaud hill area is called the Shevaroy Hills. It is situated at an altitude of 1515 metres (4970 feet) above sea level, and the highest point in Yercaud is the Servarayan temple, at 5326 feet. It is so named owing to the abundance of trees categorised as a forest near the lake, the name signifying Lake Forest.[1] As a popular tourist destination, Yercaud is also called as Jewel of the South.[2] Yarcaud is connected to city of Salem, Tamil Nadu through Highway of 8 km. The temperature never rises above 29 °C (84 °F) or goes below 13 °C (55 °F). Coffee and citrus fruits, most notably oranges, are grown in abundance apart from bananas, pears and jackfruit. Scenically, Yercaud is as enchanting and picturesque as the hill stations on the Western ghats and trekking here can be one of the most pleasurable ways to pass time.\nThe total extent of Yercaud Taluk is 382.67 km2, including Reserve Forest. The entire County is administered as a Township. Yercaud also has a Village council.","author":"swarat_ghosh","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/41599774@N00/6123781565","pop":1556,"lat":12.9558,"lng":77.621,"mdsy":0.0288023,"mdsx":-0.0335386,"tags":"travel sky cloud india tourism landscape nikon asia bangalore salem 1855mm hdr tamilnadu touristspot yercaud explored d3000 enchantingtamilnadu swaratghoshphotography","color":"#52583c","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6076/6123781565_29d26675fd_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6076/6123781565_29d26675fd_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6076/6123781565_29d26675fd_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6076/6123781565_29d26675fd.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6076/6123781565_29d26675fd_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6076/6123781565_29d26675fd_b.jpg","s":836}]},{"id":6123144179,"published":1315395523,"title":"Stargate","text":"La &quot;Puerta del mar&quot;, el &quot;No y punto&quot;... sea como sea, este viernes espero volver a encontrármelo, ya que volveré por la zona.\nUna sola toma, sin ningún tipo de filtros ni HDR, simplemente usando el método de la cartulina negra.\n?

And who is a better cook for that, than my own mother! \nSo this evening my brothers (those two were longing too) and me went over and she made us a delicious &quot;stampot&quot; from mashed potatoes

Highest Position Explore #20 September 8, 2011 Thank You!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.davidrironsjrphotography.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.davidrironsjrphotography.com</a>\n\n  Another one of those sleepless nights saw me heading out for sunrise at 2:00am! Good thing I left when I did as I had to drive the EXTREME long way around just to get to Paradise by sunrise! I almost missed this light show this morning. \n\n  They are doing some roadwork on Steven's Canyon Road, so you cannot get to Paradise from the east. You must come in from the west, from the Longmire side! Well I had to drive all of the way around through Packwood and Mineral! Talk about a marathon drive. I am just glad with all of the hiccups, I still made it to Reflection Lakes for sunrise.\n\n  The mosquitoes were definitely out in squadrons this morning. Fortunately I was bundled up with long pants and long sleeve shirt. I sprayed my face, neck and hands with the Off repellant, and for the most part I escaped serious bitage! There were quite a few other fellow photographers that were out this morning and they all had their various means of protecting themselves! We all were scrambling for our different spots where all of the &quot;Pretty&quot; flowers were! I was running all over the place trying to find a nice clump together. One fellow photographer struck the mother lode, but it required him to lay on his back to set up his tripod! \n\n  I did not have to lay on the ground, just sit on it for this image which is comprised of three exposures (-2,0,+2) merged and tonemapped in Photomatix. I then did some burning of the shadows in the foreground, removed a couple of dust spots, and ran through Topaz Adjust to bring back some of the detail. Added a bit more contrast and clarity in Lightroom, then added a slight vignette. \n\n  Thank you for your views, comments and faves. I appreciate them. I walked around Paradise, and really looks like it may be about another week and more flowers will be open. There are a lot of lupine blooming, but the Indian Paintbrush still have a little more to go. I only spotted one Avalanche Lily that was still blooming. The time for those is pretty much past. So that is the Paradise wildflower report. Will be watching some of my fellow Flickr friends posts and expecting wildflower updates! Just to think that the lake looked like this back on July 10th: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fresnatic/5925876281/\">www.flickr.com/photos/fresnatic/5925876281/</a>\n\n  Please do not use my images on blogs or websites without my permission.

But I was not really bored and very glad I brought a Nikon with me. During these 3 days I made my very first tentative steps in street photography … Have a look how I started: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/sets/72157625044600333/\">London - September 2010</a>\n\n<u>Story about this shot</u>\nAt this sunday I just finished #19, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/6105376063/in/set-72157626117942754/\">The Sunday Faced Cupholder</a>. When this following stranger came around.\n\n<u>About this stranger</u>\nMeet our #21: His name is Marcus, who turns 50 in less than two months. He was born in Portmore, a coastal city in southern Jamaica. All in all he has has been living in London for 30 years, but also lived in New York, Texas and Las Vegas. \n\nMarcus was asking me for some change. I did briefly think about giving him some change, but in the next moment I was showing him a picture on my phone. If you have looked through my previous London set instead of just reading on, you might know what I was going to show him. \n\nYep, I met him a year ago and at that time <u>he</u> was asking for a fun picture as he saw my shooting street around Brick Lane. \n&quot;Adde, I am really happy today. It is not only that you took the picture and remembered me. No, the best part is you still carry it with you. I would carry the picture of my children or my wife if a had any. I have to go back on asking you for some change.&quot;\n\nSo I asked him whether I could buy him at least something to eat instead. But he refused: &quot;To be honest I was not asking for change because I feel hungry. But I you know I have my poisons to waste money on&quot;\n\nHe told me about his four poisons: Gambling, alcohol and cocaine. Things went down the drain during a six months stay in Las Vegas. &quot;I used up a couple of chances in my life. And to make things even worse I ended up in Vegas. A place I felt home in the beginning - just until I understood how the whole system works. Especially when it comes to food. You know, it's free in Vegas, as long as  you're gambling. And I did gain a lot of weight in this short period - you know what I mean. I am trying harder and harder than ever before these days to get away from all this.&quot;\n\nAs far as you may have counted, these were only three. He laughed and added women: &quot;But apart from the other stuff women really keep me alive.&quot;\n\nMarcus lives in the streets of Brick Lane and his sleeping room is a park called Allen Gardens. His last two days were really eventful, he hadn't slept at all. So tis was supposed to b a rather short 30 minutes experience until he went off to catch up on his sleep.\n\nMarcus, our Stranger #21 is <strong>The Appreciative Rough Sleeper</strong>.\n\nI always described things the way they are, whether we like it or not. This story is hard to take.\n\n\n-- ---\nsets <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/sets/72157627575263902/with/6099270675/\">London</a>, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/sets/72157626117942754\"><strong>Triptychs of Strangers </strong></a> or <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theblackstar/sets/72157625940667541/\">Strangers</a> |  follow <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/people/theblackstar/relationship/\">flickr</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104045511944341391917\" rel=\"nofollow\">google+</a>, <a href=\"http://thenonewhitestar.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a> or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/adde_adesokan/\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter</a>","author":"theblackstar","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/54880604@N06/6126865894","pop":2029,"lat":51.5181,"lng":-0.071201,"mdsy":-0.224773,"mdsx":-0.0347986,"tags":"park street portrait england blackandwhite bw white man black london face hat dreadlocks pen mouth shoes triptych bokeh voigtlaender homeless streetphotography olympus stranger porträt jeans hut change torn sw mann schwarzweiss bricklane weiss schuhe schwarz spitalfields voigtländer mund 25mm ep1 triptychs streetphotographer triptychon obdachlos roughsleeper triptychons theblackstar epl2","color":"#aeaeae","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6126865894_bf5ccc4fec_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7000,"w":70,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6126865894_bf5ccc4fec_t.jpg","s":84},{"a":40560,"w":169,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6126865894_bf5ccc4fec_m.jpg","s":201},{"a":176000,"w":352,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6126865894_bf5ccc4fec.jpg","s":420},{"a":288000,"w":450,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6126865894_bf5ccc4fec_z.jpg","s":537},{"a":737280,"w":720,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6071/6126865894_bf5ccc4fec_b.jpg","s":859}]},{"id":6126504315,"published":1315484875,"title":"Primeras impresiones","text":"7:46 am CEST  -&gt;  ... en las nubes, en la hierba.

There were a lot of skimmers there - more than twice as many as i've seen in one place before.  #8740\n\nAs the article above implies, these black skimmers seem to consider this as their area, and if you get to a spot on the beach near where they are hanging out they send out patrols of 4-6 skimmers to dive-bomb and squawk at you - they are pretty noisy about it. Something else got them moving around for this shot - there are people with their dogs on the southwest end of this beach.\n\nThis is quite different behavior from the yearly grouping at Cape May 2nd

The numerous lakes and tarns around the area provide for some spectacular reflections. Picture Lake is perhaps the popular spot to photograph Shuksan. Though this was an item in our itinerary, we ran short of time to reach by sunset, which ensued in a mad rush through WA-20,9 and 542. In the end we showed up with a few minutes to spare for sunset. \n\nHowever I found the belt of venus to be more interesting than the Alpen Glow themselves. Had to use a GND filter to tone down the brightness of the sky and expose the reflections right. The lake and surrounding is full of mosquitos ... which made my life quite miserable, especially considering that I had to hold the filter for several seconds together in front of the lens without shaking ... (I kind of keep leaving the holder behind always ... :( ) . I did manage to massacre some of them in between the shots, but all in all, I made quite a banquet for the pesky little creatures ...\n\n\nFollow on <b><s><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/JoeDsilvaPhotography/175583869157761?sk=wall\" rel=\"nofollow\"> FaceBook</a> </s></b>","author":"Joe Dsilva","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46645318@N02/6126462024","pop":53,"lat":48.8638,"lng":-121.675,"mdsy":-0.0278231,"mdsx":0.571564,"tags":"beltofvenus northcascades northcascadesnationalpark mountshuksan picturelake lakereflection mountainreflection beltofvenusreflection mountshuksanreflection picturelakereflection","color":"#976569","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6126462024_74dff8fb56_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":67,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6126462024_74dff8fb56_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":160,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6126462024_74dff8fb56_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":333,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6126462024_74dff8fb56.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":427,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6126462024_74dff8fb56_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":683,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6126462024_74dff8fb56_b.jpg","s":836},{"a":1707200,"w":1067,"h":1600,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6063/6126462024_331349a5d6_o.jpg","s":1307}]},{"id":6123634699,"published":1315408256,"title":"A Striking Strike","text":"Explored on September 7, 2011.

It is a sea fog identified as advection fog, which is characterized by the lateral transfer of temperature by wind blowing over cooler water. In circumstances such as these, often, the water is cool enough to lower the temperature of the air to the dewpoint, causing fog generation. Coastal areas having Mediterranean climates, such as that of San Francisco, have especially frequent sea fog blowing off the ocean to just a few miles inland.\nSan Francisco's fog is created when warm, moist air blows from the central Pacific Ocean across the cold waters of the California Current, which flows just off the coast, creating a cool, moist wind.\nSan Francisco is called The Naturally Air Conditioned City because of the frequent fogs that roll in from the Pacific Ocean, especially during the months of July and August.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/2011/09/07/page44/\">www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/2011/09/07/page44/</a>","author":"Liping Photo","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44828234@N06/6123297704","pop":137,"lat":37.754,"lng":-122.447,"mdsy":-0.0401544,"mdsx":-0.310526,"tags":"","color":"#916a3f","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6123297704_0ea85dbbbe_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6123297704_0ea85dbbbe_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6123297704_0ea85dbbbe_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6123297704_0ea85dbbbe.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6123297704_0ea85dbbbe_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6123297704_0ea85dbbbe_b.jpg","s":836},{"a":7392600,"w":3330,"h":2220,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6123297704_c18b49b9a2_o.jpg","s":2719}]},{"id":6126533782,"published":1315554654,"title":"[ Explore ] Sunset To Andernos-Les Bains ~ Gironde / France ~","text":"<b>\n\nFlickr &quot;My Best Of&quot; : <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/yannick_lefevre-photography/sets/72157624950447309/\"><u><strong>TOP 100</strong></u></a>\n\nFollow Me To : <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/109876915588291208505/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b><u>Google+</u></b></a> || <a href=\"http://500px.com/Yannick_Lefevre/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b><u>500px</u></b></a> || <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Yannick-Lefevre-Photography/170544789672872/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b><u>Facebook Fan Page</u></b></a>\n\nGreat News from the 06/09 ...

the largest commissions of its day. Completed in 1627 it set the model for such decorations for the following decades. This basilica's cupola (Carlo Maderno, 1622, with the assistance of his nephew Francesco Borromini) is Rome's second largest after St. Peter's, and second in evidence on Rome's skyline.\n\nAccording to unconfirmed sources (ie Wikipedia), the first act of the opera Tosca by Puccini is set in Sant'Andrea della Valle.

I tried to push the magnification a bit, but decided f/25 gave the best views for the seeing conditions.  Ultimately, I was forced to end the session due ot the sun rising and causing the atmosphere to become turbulant.\n\nThis video is composed of 30 frames over the course of 1hr between 5:20am and

This time starting off from the Centre Island ferry point and walking rather leisurely over to the other end of the main island and back to Toronto via the Ward's Island ferry.\n\nIn what ended up being brilliant timing, we arrived at the ferry point 20 minutes before the next ferry and just before sunset. I walked along the little bit of sandy shoreline for a different view point - one that hid the sun behind a building and this is the result. I chose different viewpoints and tried longer exposures too - this is one of my favourites.\n\nThis is SOOC (Straight Out Of Camera) aside from the RAW processing and a little bit of capture sharpening. I spot-metered on the orangey sky on the left and dialled the exposure down a bit, in order to ensure the buildings were in dark silhouette. \n\n<b>NB: Really must be viewed on black (link below)!</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/clivester/sets/72157627378407723/\">Canada Set</a> | <a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=6128038070&amp;size=large\" rel=\"nofollow\">Large on Black</a> | Hit <b>L</b> for Lightbox\n\n<b>This is my twenty-fourth image that has made it into Explore!\nHighest position: #446 (8th September 2011)</b>","author":"clivester","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/10982325@N02/6128038070","pop":58,"lat":43.6319,"lng":-79.357,"mdsy":0.0178767,"mdsx":-0.363893,"tags":"blue sunset orange sunlight toronto ontario silhouette skyline clouds cityscape cntower skyscrapers panoramic explore sunrays goldenhour raysoflight torontoislands wardsisland torontoharbour canonefs1022mmf3545usm explored torontosunset sooc straightoutofcamera canoneos50d canon50d clivester","color":"#8b5e27","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6128038070_62ea06893a_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":5000,"w":100,"h":50,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6128038070_62ea06893a_t.jpg","s":71},{"a":28800,"w":240,"h":120,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6128038070_62ea06893a_m.jpg","s":170},{"a":125000,"w":500,"h":250,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6128038070_62ea06893a.jpg","s":354},{"a":204800,"w":640,"h":320,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6128038070_62ea06893a_z.jpg","s":453},{"a":524288,"w":1024,"h":512,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6089/6128038070_62ea06893a_b.jpg","s":724}]},{"id":6127790830,"published":1315502559,"title":"Red Row","text":"Project 365 B-side for September 7, 2011.

Hour Prayers | Shwedagon Paya (Pagoda) | Yangon","text":"<b>Explore(d), September 8, 2011 #345</b>\n\nGleaming in gold and decorated with diamonds, the huge <b>Shwedagon Pagoda</b> (also Shwe Dagon Pagoda or Shwedagon Paya) in Yangon is a spectacular work of Burmese temple architecture and is the holiest Buddhist shrine in Myanmar.  The pagoda dates back about 2500 years and was built to house the eight sacred hairs of the Buddha. The central stupa is 107m high and is covered with about 60 tonnes of gold leaf. The gilded hti at the top is hung with gold and silver bells and studded with gems.   The Shwedagon Pagoda is revered by the Burmese Buddhists because it is said to contain the relics of all four Enlightened Buddhas not just the relics of the present Gautama Buddha.\n\nIt is truly one of the world’s great and active spiritual sights. \n\n<b>Visit my website:  </b><a href=\"http://www.southeastasia-images.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Southeast Asia Images</b></a>","author":"I Prahin |
