Much Apprecation! \n\nLet me introduce you to Morgan, i know a lot of you guys go through my flickr and have probably seen my pictures of Lynnsey. I know that because almost all my Lynnsey pictures have the most views, you guys are creeps! Either way, this is Lynnsey's wonderful younger sister Morgan! I had the honor of shooting her Senior pictures! I was pretty stoked for this, because i dont know how you guys do it. But when i take pictures, its more just like hanging out. You know &quot;Kicking it&quot;, &quot;chillaxin&quot;, &quot;chill fish&quot;, &quot;bromosphere&quot;, &quot;errrr. uhhh. there arent as many synonyms as i thought there was. So i was pretty excited to do this. Lynnsey and Morgan show up to my house, and its all happy and dandy good times. We get to the location, and the minute i put the camera to my face. BOOM! Morgan freezes! Her happy/cheerful spirit had disappeared! But i was determined to re find it! Ive shot enough seniors to know that this happens a lot, Morgan was the epitome of &quot;I get really nervous when a camera is in my face, so im gonna tense up my body and smile stupid!&quot; I made her do some jumping jacks to relax, and with about 20 minutes of bad shots, and Lynnsey acting like a tiger and prowling all over me behind my back. We finally got Morgan to chill out, and act normal again. I was honestly scared at first, I really thought Morgan was gonna be totally lifeless the entire time! :/. I would like to boast and say that it was all me who got Morgan into the groove of taking pictures, but it was Lynnsey. She kept making Morgan laugh and got her really comfortable, if it wasnt for her being there. I would be posting any of this set on flickr, so i really gotta thank her! We hit up this really sick foresty spot, then a hilly spot after. I got some rad shots at both spots, and im uber excited to share them with you guys! :D. Morgan was a great gal to shoot! I really liked her down to earth attitude, her willingness to do anything, how calm and collect she was, and most importantly; how natural she was! :). Because you know, im a natural light photographer. eh, eh. get it?! Bad joke. I feel like i have more to say, uhhhh. I ono. I got a tumblr, ill be posting my work on there, other inspirational work and probably funny pictures or whatever i find in the tubes of the interwebs. So follow me! \n\n5D +\nLeft: 135L\nTop Right: 50 1.4\nBottom right: 50 1.4","author":"JonathanYacoub","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/38887858@N06/6162852221","pop":2855,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":0.188599,"mdsx":-0.286425,"tags":"","color":"#aa985f","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162852221_041aeb8ced_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7100,"w":100,"h":71,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162852221_041aeb8ced_t.jpg","s":84},{"a":40560,"w":240,"h":169,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162852221_041aeb8ced_m.jpg","s":201},{"a":176500,"w":500,"h":353,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162852221_041aeb8ced.jpg","s":420},{"a":288640,"w":640,"h":451,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162852221_041aeb8ced_z.jpg","s":537},{"a":739328,"w":1024,"h":722,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162852221_041aeb8ced_b.jpg","s":860},{"a":14287500,"w":4500,"h":3175,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162852221_fd147fd147_o.jpg","s":3780}]},{"id":6162066076,"published":1316418388,"title":"simplicity rock","text":"I went back to the spot where I took my last pic and did some more discovery, once again at lowish tide. The weather was rainy and had to use an umbrella over the camera a few times with the help of a buddy of mine. I decided to go even more minimal with this though.  I was keen of getting some candidates for square + mono format but as the softer coloured sunset rolled over the sky to fall on some of the East Coast  (actually it was almost better on the East than the West which is unusual) going for colour and a wider format for isolation of the rock seemed the go for my taste at this time.

Save me from those sinful thoughts :S\n\nIts good to hold my passion working, and my wife (not yet, upcoming probably) would love that than buying flowers :P\n\n\nI swear, i had to crop to 60% to bring out that stupid composition and it's very hard to compose macro shots handheld,\n\n\nAnd I will dedicate this shot to my parents who hold me back from doing stupid things with their never-ending love and care :)\n[ E X P L O R E D]\n____________________________\nPhoto Taken with Canon EOS 1D MkiiN &amp; Canon EF 100mm f2.8 Macro (non USM version)\nTaken From Boiddyer bazar, Narayangang, Bangladesh.\n\n<b>Copyright: Abdul Aziz Apu\nContact: apu029@gmail.com</b>","author":"ছায়াশিকারী (double-A Apu)","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7924055@N03/6162289343","pop":269,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":-0.00153892,"mdsx":-0.304144,"tags":"macro green canon herbs 100mm dhaka bangladesh tender 100mmmacro 1dmkii narayangang","color":"#738943","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6162289343_240bc08b88_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":10000,"w":100,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6162289343_240bc08b88_t.jpg","s":100},{"a":57600,"w":240,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6162289343_240bc08b88_m.jpg","s":240},{"a":250000,"w":500,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6162289343_240bc08b88.jpg","s":500},{"a":409600,"w":640,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6162289343_240bc08b88_z.jpg","s":640},{"a":1000000,"w":1000,"h":1000,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6158/6162289343_240bc08b88_b.jpg","s":1000}]},{"id":6161521427,"published":1316418131,"title":"Dégradé de bleu","text":"Vu sur <a href=\"http://www.flickriver.com/explore/interesting/24hours/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.flickriver.com/explore/interesting/24hours/</a>","author":"zmi66","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34093087@N03/6161521427","pop":374,"lat":40.9614,"lng":8.20988,"mdsy":0.090631,"mdsx":0.548133,"tags":"show trip light sea summer mer art nature nikon eau raw lausanne italie stintino d700 vacancessardaigne","color":"#5a94c8","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6161521427_f8fe9310a2_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":10000,"w":100,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6161521427_f8fe9310a2_t.jpg","s":100},{"a":57600,"w":240,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6161521427_f8fe9310a2_m.jpg","s":240},{"a":250000,"w":500,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6161521427_f8fe9310a2.jpg","s":500},{"a":409600,"w":640,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6161521427_f8fe9310a2_z.jpg","s":640},{"a":1048576,"w":1024,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6161521427_f8fe9310a2_b.jpg","s":1024},{"a":7123561,"w":2669,"h":2669,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6161521427_554f4a00ed_o.jpg","s":2669}]},{"id":6163478309,"published":1316463888,"title":"Tunnel Vision III","text":"Taken with a camera mounted on a tripod behind the windscreen of a moving car in one of the tunnels along E16 in western Norway. \n\nPart of my <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/verhelstaal/sets/72157627608996566/show\">Tunnel Vision series</a>.\n\nEXIF: 6 s, f/22, ISO 200, 19 mm.\n\n© 2011 by Papafrezzo Photography.

I decided on Thursday that I would do it then.\n\nI had stopped at the grocery store on my way home from work and realized that I was losing light really fast. I got home, changed quickly and headed back out. \n\nI parked in a spot just off the road and walked through high weeds and didn't know what I might find there. Nothing much was inside and there was a lot of graffiti on the inside walls. I set up my tripod in front of this side that faced the setting sun. \n\nI had no ideas before I got here as far as what to shoot. Keeping in mind that I wanted to reflect a mood, I thought this shot would work best closer up rather than trying to capture the entire barn, because it's huge (I'll have to come back again). Besides, I liked this door frame and the peeling paint. \n\nI hope I've conveyed my content mood. I am happy where I am in life and am looking positively to the future, both short term as well as long term. \n\nFor <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1688111@N24/\">Me Again Monday</a> Theme for Monday September 19th - mood\n\n","author":"~ cynthiak ~","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/38058941@N00/6163854199","pop":318,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":0.248797,"mdsx":-0.203798,"tags":"sunset selfportrait green barn mood happiness karma mam goldenhour peacefulness contentment selfie 2011 52weeks explored meagainmonday trespassnig","color":"#b49772","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6163854199_0b0399845c_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":67,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6163854199_0b0399845c_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":160,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6163854199_0b0399845c_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":333,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6163854199_0b0399845c.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":427,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6163854199_0b0399845c_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":683,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6163854199_0b0399845c_b.jpg","s":836}]},{"id":6161469653,"published":1316416409,"title":"Life","text":"Model: Marta\n\nExplored Sept 19, 2011\n\nPress ''L''\n© All rights reserved.

I was actually hoping to use a pure white bowl (we didn't have any) but then I figured the photo would have no real depth to it, though I'm sure it might be a little interesting if done correctly. \n\nThe number one issue I came across when I was shooting this was the reflection of the camera and the tripod in the milk. I fiddled around for a bit trying to hid it but in the end I photoshopped them out.

It's a combo of 3 shots though. One with a larger aperture to get the flowers still (it was windy), one for the rest of the landscape in focus, and one for the sky (the sun is just beyond the flowers so it's super bright). It was a tricky situation because waiting for colourful light would mean the Palouse wouldn't look as magical but now the sky isn't &quot;on fire.&quot; Meh, what can you do :) I'm slowly learning how to use Photoshop for manual exposure blending so perhaps I'll do a tutorial one day, we'll see how time goes. \n\nToday I wanted to talk about the idea of relationship. If there is one thing I've noticed, it's that Christians really do want a relationship with God. I think that we see the fire that others have and we see how happy they are and we crave that. But we want it in some easy form, we want to swallow a pill and get on with our day. I hate to break it to you but that's not how a relationship works. How close would you be with your friends or family if you never spent time with them?\n\nYou want a fire for God? You want to experience Him more deeply? Then you have to make time for Him. Read your Bible and spend time in prayer. I know it's sickeningly simple, but that's just how it is. It might mean that you have to say &quot;no&quot; to other things. Sometimes we have to say &quot;no&quot; because we've already said &quot;yes&quot; to something else. It's just the way life goes. If we don't take that step we'll keep putting our relationship with God on the shelf and it'll never go anywhere. Do we really believe that we were created solely to live for God? Do your actions show that?\n\nI don't say this to make you feel bad. I say this because I want you to experience God fully, I want you to know just how awesome He is!!! We always say things like &quot;God is my everything&quot; but is it really true? Make it true! The people in life who are really furthering God's Kingdom are the ones who are actually spending time with Him. The people who set aside 30 minutes or an hour to spend time with Him each day, those are the ones who impact lives. I use to think that was ridiculous, that it was impossible to have that kind of time taken up each day. But now I can't live without it. \n\nDon't let this message pass you by. You can read it, move on and keep your relationship with God on the shelf. Or you can decide to change, decide that you want God more than anything else. God never asks us to give up anything but until we step out in faith, He can't work.

This was one of the last photographs I took at Upper Titcomb Lake. Here are the waypoints for where this photo was taken and where we had our camp in Titcomb Basin:\n\nThis photograph taken from the south end of Upper Titcomb Lake:\nN43 7 23  W109 38 18 at 10,604'.\n\nOur camp site on the south end of Lower Titcomb Lake:\nN46 6 32  W109 38 11 at 10,603'\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe second day of our backpacking trip, from getting up in the morning at our Seneca Lake camp until climbing into our sleeping bags under a full moon (and short rain session) at Titcomb Basin, everything was superlatives. The hiking, the scenery, and photo ops, were the absolute best.\n\nWe arrived early at our Titcomb Basin camp site (night #2) so we all had lots of time to roam the granite high country (10,500’) at will. All four of us hiked together from our camp to Upper Titcomb Lake to get a close view and good feel for the basin itself. \n\nBackpackers passing us on their way out on day one of our backpacking trip had reported high winds in Titcomb Basin, so when we arrived there we were overjoyed to find mill pond like conditions on Upper Titcomb, while we were there taking photographs. Later clouds moved in quickly for a short time, right at nightfall, rain came down. I quickly put the rain fly on my tent and retreated to its warm wind and rain protected interior.\n\nOur time in Titcomb Basin is what I treasure most from this backpacking trip and I hope you can feel some of the rugged beauty of the area through the various photographs I took with my two little point and shoot Canon cameras (G9 &amp; G10).\n\n◙ THE STORY ◙\nElkhart Park to Titcomb Basin Backpacking trip.\nFour days &amp; 27 miles ~ September 9th - 12th, 2011.\n\nHOW THE TRIP CAME TO BE:\nI love to prowl used bookstores. 98% of what I buy is non-fiction. History, travel and trail guide books always seem to find their way to my house. My wife buys shoes. I buy books. \n\nI have a long standing habit of writing the date and place where I buy a book. So it was that on 17 February 2011, at a used book store in Union Gap, Washington - I purchased: High Country Trail “Along the Continental Divide” by Michael Robbins. Photographed by Paul Chesley. \n\nI paid two dollars for this little hard bound book. I leafed through the pages and there on pages 118 and 121, I saw photographs of a place in the Jim Bridger Wilderness of Wyoming’s Wind River Range, that knocked my hiking socks off. Wow. I knew that if I could find a way to do so…that I needed to go there. So the research began.\n\nI have done lots of backpacking but I’m not a backpacker. I don’t like carrying a heavy load on my back for endless miles (even if you “go light”) ~ UNLESS it is the only reasonable ticket to a spectacular place where a day hike isn’t a practical way to go. Such was the case with Island Lake and Titcomb Basin in the Wind River Range. To see, experience and enjoy it, I knew it needed to be a backpacking trip.\n\nMy favorite companion on road trips, hikes, and backpacking trips is my wife. We have been married over 40 years and love doing things together. Here are links for my flickr photo site, to a few of the backpacking trips we have taken together:\n\nBackpacking trip in Coyote Gulch in Utah with my wife in April 2009:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12150532@N04/sets/72157617350433766/\">www.flickr.com/photos/12150532@N04/sets/72157617350433766/</a>\n\nBackpacking trip in the Eagle Cap Wilderness with my wife in September 2010:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12150532@N04/sets/72157606923690950/\">www.flickr.com/photos/12150532@N04/sets/72157606923690950/</a>\n\nBackpacking trip up Grand Gulch on a road trip with my wife in March of 2011:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12150532@N04/sets/72157626474968215/\">www.flickr.com/photos/12150532@N04/sets/72157626474968215/</a>\n\nBut, if my wife can’t go (she works part time) or if it is a hike or backpacking trip that might be a little bit more than she would enjoy and feel comfortable with, I will usually try to find another hiking companion or go “solo” rather than “stay home”. \n\nSolo backpacking trip to Tuck and Robin Lakes in September 2009:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12150532@N04/sets/72157622429820868/\">www.flickr.com/photos/12150532@N04/sets/72157622429820868/</a>\n\nMy wife and I both quickly agreed that the Titcomb Basin backpacking trip was one that would be best if she skipped. So I set about planning the trip, with the thought of finding at least one backpacking partner to join me on it. \n\nI bought hiking guides and maps for the Wind River Range and studied the many possibilities to best see, in person, the spectacular landscapes I had seen in the “Along the Continental Divide” book. I wasn’t happy with the maps I bought so I got the Wyoming National Geographic topo map software and started creating my own maps for the trip. I laminate a few of the maps so a rain doesn’t destroy their value on the trail.\n\nI chose a narrow window in September (the first two weeks) to avoid too many people, too many mosquitoes, and to get the trip in before hunting season and any major snow falls, closed the area for the season. \n\nThe total elevation gain on the backpacking trip would not be that great, nor would the number of trail miles, BUT the hike begins at around 9,300 feet and stays mostly above 10,000 feet (with a high point of 10,600 or so) - - which met the nights could likely be quite cold and then there is the issue of backpacking at altitude. I would want to backpack light but make certain that I carried enough gear to be safe and comfortable.\n\nIt turned out the round trip backpacking trip covered 27 miles with another four or five miles of “day hiking” thrown in. I felt I could do the trip solo if needed but I really felt it would be smarter, safer, and more fun if I could get at least one other person with backpacking experience to go with me. Enter Sawtooth photography (Fred) of flickr fame.\n\nOn a 3,000 mile road trip to the Four Corners area with another friend, Ed, in March of 2011, we stopped in Boise for lunch at the Cracker Barrel restaurant (a place I seek like a magnet - since we don’t have them in the state of Washington). Fred met us for lunch and it was the first time I had met him, though we had exchanged hiking stories and information, through flickr, for years. \n\nFred is an experienced hiker/backpacker and very sharing with his formidable knowledge of hiking the Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho. He even sent me a book and a map a few years back, on the hiking there.\n\nSo, knowing through Flickr, that Fred was an avid and capable backpacker, I brought the subject of Titcomb Basin in the Wind River Range of Wyoming, up during our lunch conversation. He was sold and now I had somebody to do the trip with. I would feel much better doing this trip with another backpacker, since this is the year I turn 65; the backpacking is 800 miles from my home; and on the second day I would be somewhere around 14 miles from the trailhead in country I hadn’t hiked before.\n\nThe trip was on! I posted a photocopy of Titcomb Basin on the side of a bookshelf, next to my computer and kept looking at from March of 2011, until the dream became reality. We had a lot of good fortune all along the way. The date we chose for the four day backpacking trip (9.9.11 through 9.12.11) never had to be moved due to weather or anything else. \n\nOver the next six months, Fred and I exchanged emails on the Wind River Backpacking trip. Later, with Fred’s consent, I invited my brother and a good friend, both of whom I had hiked, backpacked, and road tripped with in the past. It was a four party team I felt very comfortable with and now my only worry about the entire trip became weather in the high country of the Wind River Range. \n\nWhen it became obvious that we had hit a lucky weather window for our planned backpacking trip - the four of us headed for Pinedale, Wyoming. Fred drove solo from his home near Boise; JJ drove solo making the trip in two days from his house to Pinedale; and my brother and I car pooled in his Jeep Liberty, taking our time and three days to arrive in Pinedale, Wyoming (elevation near 7,300 feet).\n\nOnce the team was set at four, the four of us started exchanging information, internet links, and thoughts on about the trip. One of the team members sent me a link about a sad story I had not come across during my trip research. It is the story of Mike Turner, who hiked the same route we would be hiking from Elkhart Park past Island Lake, where Mike and his dog, Andy, turned toward Indian Basin and our team continued on to Titcomb Basin.\n\nMike Turner had an ambitious route that involved some travel in a remote portion of the Wind River Range. Circumstances and one mishap cost him his life. It reinforced my feeling that the Titcomb Basin trip for me would best be done with the company of at least one other experienced hiker.\n\nThe Mike Turner story took place in August 1998. It was printed in Backpacker magazine in 2002. Here is the link should you want to read the Mike Turner story (and reflect on it a bit as well):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.backpacker.com/june_2002_feature_survival_hiker_mike_turner_wyoming/articles/4585\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.backpacker.com/june_2002_feature_survival_hiker_mike_...</a>\n\nThis backpacking trip started with a few pages of photographs in a two dollar used book, purchased toward the end of winter in the Pacific Northwest. For me, it culminated on setting my one man REI quarter dome T1 tent up, on a high granite outcropping, looking across Lower Titcomb Lake at the rugged peaks of the Wind River Range. I had dreamed of sleeping in my backpacking tent with this view, and my dream came true. A big thanks to Fred, my brother, and JJ, for the big part they played in making that dream come true for me.\n\nCAST OF CHARACTERS:\nOMT ~ Oldmantravels: 64, soon to turn 65. Packed a 30 year old Kelty Tioga external frame pack. Slept in a REI Quarter Dome T1 tent. Photographed with a Canon G9 and G10. Home in Eastern Washington.\n\nSP ~ SawtoothPhotography: Probably in his mid 40s. Carried the heaviest load of any of us, in a Gregory internal frame pack. Boldly slept in a light, but weatherproof Bivy sack. Packed professional grade and multiple cameras plus a small wooden pinhole camera; a point and shoot camera; and was caught at least once, taking photos with his cell phone.\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sawtoothphoto/\">www.flickr.com/photos/sawtoothphoto/</a>\n\nMB ~ My Brother: 62. Used a Kelty external frame pack. Slept in a new Sierra Designs Zolo 1 backpacking tent. Took memory keeping snapshots with a small. light “point and shoot” camera. Became the pace maker for our hiking as he is an experienced backpacker with a perfect trail pace, that worked for us all. We kept him up front.\n\nJJ ~ School days friend of my brother and me. My brother’s age. He slept in a custom made, super light, tough, trekking pole supported, one man backpacking tent. JJ kept his over all load the lightest of the four of us and used a Gregory internal frame backpack. Like Fred, he qualifies as a professional photographer. He brought his Canon professional grade camera on the trip.\n\n\nTRIP TO THE TRAILHEAD:\nMy brother and I broke up our trip down to Pinedale into three bite size segments. After spending the night at my house, the two of us headed for Missoula, Montana on the morning of Tuesday September 6th, 2011. We took the slow, scenic route up the Clearwater River and over lovely Lolo Pass. We stayed the night in Missoula, where just by happenstance there resides a Cracker Barrel restaurant. \n\nWe had dinner there Tuesday night and a big breakfast there Wednesday morning. Wednesday (9.7.11) we drove to Idaho Falls and spent the night there. Thursday it was a short (and scenic) drive over to the Snake River at Hoback Junction, and then up the Hoback River through “Mountain Man” (fur trapper) country to Pinedale, Wyoming.\n\nI made a fortunate find researching “places to stay” in Pinedale, Wyoming. Looking on line and confirming with the Pinedale chamber of commerce, I booked a two bedroom cabin at the historic, rustic, well kept, owned and operated by efficient, fair and friendly people: The Log Cabin Motel. JJ reserved a two bedroom cabin there as well, so the four of us all bunked in cabins at Pinedale on the night before the backpacking trip.\n\nJJ arrived soon after my brother and I did, so the three of us went up to the Museum of the Mountain Man in Pinedale. I have read almost every book you could think of on the days of men of the fur trading times. Jim Bridger is one of my heroes, though I would not have wanted to have lived the tough, dangerous lives that they did.\n\nThe museum was a hit. Much bigger and more professional than I had imagined and all three of us enjoyed our time there. Then the three of us split up. JJ (a former high school coach and media teacher), dropped by the local high school to watch their football practice. My brother and I decided to take the 15 mile paved scenic drive up to the Elkhart Park trailhead, just to get the lay of the land. \n\nAfter my brother and I returned from the trailhead reconnaissance, JJ was at the cabins and SP (Fred) arrived. It was great for the four of us to all be in Pinedale, with all of our backpacking gear and a good weather forecast holding steady for the four days we would be in the Jim Bridger Wilderness, backpacking.\n\nWe ate dinner in Pinedale together then returned to our cabins to organize our gear and be ready for an early morning trip up to the trailhead.\n\nHere is a link to the mountain man museum in Pinedale. It was really something for me to see the 1853 rifle that was engraved and given to Jim Bridger in the museum. I learned a lot from my visit to the museum and thoroughly enjoyed it. Stop by there if you are ever near downtown, Pinedale. Museum of the Mountain Man in Pinedale, Wyoming:\n<a href=\"http://www.museumofthemountainman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.museumofthemountainman.com/</a>\n\nThere are some new multi-story national chain motels in Pinedale these days and probably more will go up, but if you really want a fun stay I highly recommend the\nLog Cabin Motel in Pinedale, Wyoming.\n\nThey went as far as storing our gear for us, that we weren’t taking on the backpacking trip (and therefore would have to leave in a trailhead car), for four days while we were gone backpacking. This they did cheerfully and for free, even though we didn’t have a reservation for a cabin following the last day of our backpacking trip (we were all heading for home). Here is the link for The Log Cabin Motel in Pinedale, Wyoming:\n<a href=\"http://www.thelogcabinmotel.com/lodging.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.thelogcabinmotel.com/lodging.php</a>\n\nTHE BACKPACKING TRIP:\nI will keep this portion of the narrative short and let the photographs I post, speak for themselves. Here is a rough outline of the backpacking itself:\n\nDay One (Friday 9.9.11): Start hiking at the Elkhart Park trailhead near 9,300 feet. We shouldered our packs at 8:00 am. No permit or registration required though we did fill out the voluntary registration at the trailhead.\n\nThe first four and half miles to Photographer’s Point is the main elevation you gain at one time (1,000 feet) and it is accomplished on a gentle grade and under the shade of pine trees. We hiked on to the north end of Seneca Lake, where we set up our camp for the first night. This is about nine miles from the Elkhart Park trailhead. \n\nWe camped on a peninsula of Seneca at the suggestion of the photographer/owner of the Outdoor Store in Pinedale. A nice store and knowledgeable helpful owner. We filtered our water from the lake and the two Jetboil stoves we brought had no problem with the altitude. Beautiful moon at night.\n\nDay Two (Saturday 9.10.11). Backpack around Little Seneca Lake then climb to the ridge overlooking Island Lake for outstanding views and one of the highlights of the trail for me. We took a photo ops break here, then on down to the S.E. end of the long narrow and gorgeous Island Lake.\n\nThe view of Titcomb Basin, when it first comes into view, after climbing up and out of the Island Lake bowl, far exceeded my expectations and my expectations were exceedingly high. What a sight!\n\nWe talked with a solo mountain climber, hiking out of Titcomb Basin (one of the few hikers we ran into in the basin). He had just succeeded, after three failed attempts, to summit Gannet Peak. He smiled at the external frame Kelty packs, which my brother and I were carrying. He too had one, loaded to the hilt AND with a heavy medium sized internal frame “climbing pack” slung beneath it. “You know” he said “If you really need to carry a LOT of weight, you can’t beat these old Kelty external frames”. \n\nThe climber told us that the camping at the north end of Upper Titcomb Lake was “stark, cloudy, and windy” and he recommended we camp at Lower Titcomb or near the various small waterfalls down below Lower Titcomb.\n\nIt was on a rock granite outcropping that I found the place I had dreamed of camping. My brother and JJ found a site that suited them (and a bit away from my loud snoring reputation), and SP didn’t bother spending too much time looking for a tent site, since his warm snug bivy bag would fit anywhere he liked and required not work to “set up”. Fred reached for his camera gear instead.\n\n\nAfter the Lower Titcomb Lake camp was set up, the four of grabbed our cameras and took a day hike up to Upper Titcomb Lake. Here I got my favorite photographs of the entire backpack trip. Though people hiking out the day before said it had been “terribly windy” in the Titcomb Basin, we found the upper lake in mill pond calm for a long enough period of time to snap reflecting photographs as quickly as we could.\n\nBack at camp, it was filter water, cook dinner, and take more photographs. While the four of us were wandering about exploring the area in which we were camped, rain clouds spilled over Fremont Peak and it began to rain. My brother and I hot footed it back to camp to put our rain flies on our tents. No worry for Fred with his bivy bag or JJ with his new lightweight single wall tent.\n\nI went to sleep that night with rain tapping on the tent fly, then the clouds would race away into the night and the full moon would totally light up the interior of my tent. Coyotes howled for a short while (I thought Fred was using his cell phone HA). This was the best night’s sleep I got by far. What a place to spend the night.\n\nDay Three (Sunday 9.11.11) The weather was great when we got up Sunday morning. My brother, who had a small thermometer with him, said it was 28 degrees. After some more photo ops we started backpacking our way back the way we came. I thought about Mike Turner when we passed the Indian Basin trail junction.\n\nWe hiked all the way to Barbara Lake (near Eklund Lake) to make an early camp and spend the last night of our backpacking trip. It was a little over 8 miles from our Lower Titcomb Lake camp to the place we camped at Barbara Lake. It was a relaxing evening around Barbara Lake, a forest and meadow ringed small lake, right along the trail.\n\nDay Four (Monday 9.12.11) Frost was all around when we woke up Monday morning at Barbara Lake and as the morning sun started to warm the air, the frost quickly turned to moisture, so some of our gear was a little wet as we packed our backpacks for the fourth and final time. It was an easy 5.5 mile hike from our camp at Barbara Lake back to the Elkhart Park trailhead. We shook hands at the trailhead then started sorting and organizing our gear for our trips back home.\n\nWe were all back in Pinedale by noon, picking up our stored gear at the Log Cabin Motel, and getting ready to head our separate ways. Fred headed off toward Boise. My brother and I had decided to cut through Yellowstone on our way home. JJ was going to Teton National Park for some specific photo opportunities. As it turned out all three of us ended up staying Monday night in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, so we were able to have a nice dinner together (at The Bunnery, a place that JJ knew of and served excellent food).\n\nMy brother and I spent some time in Yellowstone on Tuesday morning, then on to Missoula to spend the night there. Wednesday I arrived home with a lot of great memories and I hope a few photographs to remember them by. I was very lucky to have had Fred, my brother, and JJ as quality company on this trip. We each had different approaches to gear, camping methods, and photography priorities, but we all stuck together and covered a lot of fun trail miles together. \n\nI sincerely hope some of you out there in flickr land enjoy my photographs of this backpacking trip and benefit it some small way from the narrative and photos, should you decide to plan a trip of your own to the rugged and scenic country.

I've always wanted to go into this building everytime I pass it and on Saturday morning I had that opportunity :-). I only had to que about 25 minutes and once in I was expecting expansive floors and a high atrium which I did get but what I wasn't expecting was how close the office desks were crammed together (you can just see them in the photo above). It must also get very noisy in here as there are just desks and desks everywhere but it is such an awesome building, a highlight from the weekend. \n\n<b>Photo Details</b>\nSony A700\nTamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR\nRAW\nHDR\nf/9\n24mm\nISO640\n1/10s exposure\n\n<b>Software Used</b>\nLightroom 3.0\nPTLens\nPhotomatix 4.1\n\n<b>Information</b>\nThe Lloyd's building (also sometimes known as the Inside-Out Building) is the home of the insurance institution Lloyd's of London, and is located at 1, Lime Street, in the City of London, England.\n\nIt was designed by architect Richard Rogers and built between 1978 and 1986. Bovis was the management contractor for the scheme. Like the Pompidou Centre (designed by Renzo Piano and Rogers), the building was innovative in having its services such as staircases, lifts, electrical power conduits and water pipes on the outside, leaving an uncluttered space inside. The twelve glass lifts were the first of their kind in the UK. It is important to note that (like the Pompidou Centre) this building was highly influenced by the work of Archigram in the 1950s and 1960s (see Plug-in City by Archigram for an example).\n\nThe building consists of three main towers and three service towers around a central, rectangular space. Its focal point is the large Underwriting Room on the ground floor, which houses the famous Lutine Bell. The Underwriting Room (often simply known as the Room) is overlooked by galleries, forming a 60 metres (197 ft) high atrium lit naturally through a huge barrel-vaulted glass roof. The first four galleries open onto the atrium space, and are connected by escalators through the middle of the structure. The higher floors are glassed-in, and can only be reached via the outside lifts.\n\nThe 11th floor houses the Committee Room, an 18th century dining-room designed for the 2nd Earl of Shelburne by Robert Adam in 1763; it was transferred piece-by-piece from the previous (1958) Lloyd's building across the road.\n\nThe first Lloyd's building (at 12 Leadenhall Street) was built on this site in 1928. In 1958, due to expansion, a new building was constructed across the road at 51 Lime Street. In 1978, again due to the prospect of overcrowding, Lloyd's commissioned Richard Rogers to redevelop the site and the original 1928 building was demolished to make way for the present one which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986. However, its entrance at 12 Leadenhall Street was preserved, and forms a rather incongruous attachment to the 1986 structure. Demolition of the 1958 building commenced in 2004 to make way for the Willis Building, a new 26-storey tower and ten-storey building.\n\nThe Lloyd's building is 88 metres (289 ft) to the roof, with 14 floors. On top of each service core stand the cleaning cranes pushing the height to 95.10 metres (312 ft). Modular in plan, each floor can be altered with the addition or removal of partitions and walls.\nIn 2008, The Twentieth Century Society called for the building to be Grade I listed.\n\nThe building is owned by Dublin-based real estate firm Shelbourne Development, who purchased the building in 2004 from a German investment bank.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd's_building\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd's_building</a>","author":"TurnipFarmer","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/36326099@N05/6161704317","pop":161,"lat":51.513,"lng":-0.082274,"mdsy":0.090668,"mdsx":-0.0496581,"tags":"city uk greatbritain england people urban building green london glass lines yellow architecture modern concrete grey office europe desk unitedkingdom sony escalator pillar perspective thecity line gb escalators alpha pillars vignetting vignette hdr highdynamicrange offices desks limestreet cityoflondon officeblock lloydsbuilding richardrogers lloydsoflondon squaremile northeastlondon a700 openhouselondon tamronspaf1750mmf28xrdiii sonyalpha700 dslra700 insideoutbuilding","color":"#766c5b","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6174/6161704317_a43d0031da_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6300,"w":63,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6174/6161704317_a43d0031da_t.jpg","s":79},{"a":36240,"w":151,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6174/6161704317_a43d0031da_m.jpg","s":190},{"a":157500,"w":315,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6174/6161704317_a43d0031da.jpg","s":397},{"a":258560,"w":404,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6174/6161704317_a43d0031da_z.jpg","s":508},{"a":661504,"w":646,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6174/6161704317_a43d0031da_b.jpg","s":813}]},{"id":6161655257,"published":1316422156,"title":"sokcho lighthouse","text":"Please refrain from using icons/banners/images in the comments.","author":"andrew c ko","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21892108@N05/6161655257","pop":83,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":0.184011,"mdsx":-0.0105617,"tags":"bw cloud lighthouse square jetty perspective railing southkorea sokcho fense gangwondo","color":"#8d8d8d","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6161655257_4c31175e16_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":10000,"w":100,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6161655257_4c31175e16_t.jpg","s":100},{"a":57600,"w":240,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6161655257_4c31175e16_m.jpg","s":240},{"a":250000,"w":500,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6161655257_4c31175e16.jpg","s":500},{"a":409600,"w":640,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6161655257_4c31175e16_z.jpg","s":640},{"a":640000,"w":800,"h":800,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6161655257_4c31175e16_b.jpg","s":800}]},{"id":6164304430,"published":1316469703,"title":"(Explored!)","text":"<a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=6164304430\" rel=\"nofollow\">View On Black</a>  | <a href=\"http://spoken-weakness.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> tumblr</a> \n\nHere is the other from yesterday :) \n\nExplored #136 - Thanks so much once again!

It is almost like a stage set, nay, make that a movie set, perhaps a Disney flick? \nEvery window has lace curtains and flower boxes with geraniums, all the buildings are in good repair, and the architecture is infinitely interesting. Low-country designs of the Middle Ages were a matter of pride; every detail down to the outline of a window frame is beautifully proportioned. \nIn the heart of the downtown, motor vehicles are prohibited, except for deliveries during restricted hours, making it one of the easiest walking cities of the world, safe and well-signed. The winding cobbled streets, adjacent to the canals, are shared by pedestrians and the occasional horse-drawn carriage. Sweepers follow the horses and keep the streets litter free.\nRestaurants serve authentic Belgian cooking, a strong rival to French cuisine, as well as numerous international style dishes. Fresh fish, cooked a thousand different ways, is plentiful, as are beautiful homegrown vegetables. Of course, this country is famous for its chocolate, a worthy choice for dessert. My own personal favorite Belgian meal is carpes frites plus pommes frites, which would be called ‘fish and chips’ anywhere else, but is in fact a perfect delicacy here in Bruges.\n","author":"holland fotograaf","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31066444@N05/6162304543","pop":897,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":0.0703916,"mdsx":-0.113136,"tags":"light iso100 belgium tripod brugge painter f22 sec 13 marvelous flanders canon1740 canon5dmark2 hollandfotograaf","color":"#735c4f","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6162/6162304543_78c461a7cd_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":8500,"w":100,"h":85,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6162/6162304543_78c461a7cd_t.jpg","s":92},{"a":49200,"w":240,"h":205,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6162/6162304543_78c461a7cd_m.jpg","s":222},{"a":213500,"w":500,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6162/6162304543_78c461a7cd.jpg","s":462},{"a":349440,"w":640,"h":546,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6162/6162304543_78c461a7cd_z.jpg","s":591}]},{"id":6162269890,"published":1316424599,"title":"Weekendje","text":"We waren met de fotoclub een weekendje in het  Waterpark Zwartkruis.. het is prachtig gelegen aan het water in het mooie Friesland.

The poem was composed one night after he experienced an opium influenced dream after reading a work describing the Tartar king Kublai Khan. Upon waking, he set about writing lines of poetry that came to him from the dream until he was interrupted by a person from Porlock. The poem was never finished as he forgot what lines came next because of the interruption.\n\nImage photographed at Broken Islands Sea Shore, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada\n\n****************************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n&quot;In Xanadu did Kubla Khan\nA stately pleasure-dome decree:\nWhere Alph, the sacred river, ran\nThrough caverns measureless to man\nDown to a sunless sea.\n\nSo twice five miles of fertile ground\nWith walls and towers were girdled round:\nAnd there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,\nWhere blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;\nAnd here were forests ancient as the hills,\nEnfolding sunny spots of greenery.\n\nBut oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted\nDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!\nA savage place! as holy and enchanted\nAs e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted\nBy woman wailing for her demon-lover!\nAnd from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,\nAs if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,\nA mighty fountain momently was forced:\nAmid whose swift half-intermitted burst\nHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,\nOr chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:\nAnd 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever\nIt flung up momently the sacred river.\nFive miles meandering with a mazy motion\nThrough wood and dale the sacred river ran,\nThen reached the caverns measureless to man,\nAnd sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:\nAnd 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far\nAncestral voices prophesying war!\n\nThe shadow of the dome of pleasure\nFloated midway on the waves;\nWhere was heard the mingled measure\nFrom the fountain and the caves.\nIt was a miracle of rare device,\nA sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!\n\nA damsel with a dulcimer\nIn a vision once I saw:\nIt was an Abyssinian maid,\nAnd on her dulcimer she played,\nSinging of Mount Abora.\nCould I revive within me\nHer symphony and song,\nTo such a deep delight 'twould win me\nThat with music loud and long\nI would build that dome in air,\nThat sunny dome! those caves of ice!\nAnd all who heard should see them there,\nAnd all should cry, Beware! Beware!\nHis flashing eyes, his floating hair!\nWeave a circle round him thrice,\nAnd close your eyes with holy dread,\nFor he on honey-dew hath fed\nAnd drunk the milk of Paradise.&quot;\n","author":"jackaloha2","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/36607702@N08/6163560732","pop":336,"lat":48.9064,"lng":-125.518,"mdsy":0.166275,"mdsx":-0.377263,"tags":"trees sun mist canada birds islands ancient poetry poem britishcolumbia dream vancouverisland layer legend ucluelet mystic timeless kublakhan texturedlayers magicunicornverybest jackaloha2 photoshopcs5 brokenislandsseashore","color":"#bc7842","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6163560732_50c20bc818_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7500,"w":100,"h":75,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6163560732_50c20bc818_t.jpg","s":87},{"a":43440,"w":240,"h":181,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6163560732_50c20bc818_m.jpg","s":208},{"a":188500,"w":500,"h":377,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6163560732_50c20bc818.jpg","s":434},{"a":309120,"w":640,"h":483,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6163560732_50c20bc818_z.jpg","s":556},{"a":791552,"w":1024,"h":773,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6163560732_50c20bc818_b.jpg","s":890},{"a":4348800,"w":2400,"h":1812,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6163560732_e697dcdd65_o.jpg","s":2085}]},{"id":6163513793,"published":1316464589,"title":"Forth rail and road bridges","text":"","author":"xett_pl","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/63586113@N04/6163513793","pop":52,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":0.0817531,"mdsx":-0.508732,"tags":"","color":"#bd680d","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6163513793_d0876e083e_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6600,"w":100,"h":66,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6163513793_d0876e083e_t.jpg","s":81},{"a":38160,"w":240,"h":159,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6163513793_d0876e083e_m.jpg","s":195},{"a":166000,"w":500,"h":332,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6163513793_d0876e083e.jpg","s":407},{"a":272000,"w":640,"h":425,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6163513793_d0876e083e_z.jpg","s":522},{"a":696320,"w":1024,"h":680,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6177/6163513793_d0876e083e_b.jpg","s":834}]},{"id":6163033642,"published":1316444207,"title":"TRA CAMPI DORATI   -   GOLD FIELDS BETWEEN............

About what I want. Who I am. Who I want to be. Where I want to go. And I realized…that I need to stop trying to manipulate my life. \n\nI am in control of what I do. And that’s it. I am going to stop trying to make every single thing go my way. I’m learning to take life as it comes at me. And make the best of it. I have a passion…and now it’s my turn. My job to turn what I’ve been given into something. And I realized, that I only need one person in my life to do that. And that’s me. Who do I want to be? Or rather…who am I? I am a strong person. And sure, I may not have been through the things some of you have…but what I have been through has hurt too, and it has affected me. The things I experience everyday teach me something. But I think the biggest lesson I have learned through it all…is to learn to let go. The past few moths I have been thinking letting go is never easy. Because holding onto the past feels good. But sometimes, you need to let go…to make room for the rest of your life. And nothing has ever been more true. I used to hold onto everything so tightly for fear that I might forget or it might slip away…that I suffocated it. It died. And all I was left with were broken memories. But I’ve let go. Because dwelling on the past never gets anyone anywhere. It was holding me back. I couldn’t keep regretting things I had done..or said. Because there’s nothing I can do about it now. It happened. And it happened for a reason. I may not know that reason right now, but someday…I will be thankful that it happened. Most people say “Live for today.” But I say “Live for tomorrow.” Because what’s the point of living if you never have aspirations, dreams, plans or wishes? Life was made to be fulfilled. And I plan to do just that. I have dreams.

You look at their stream, they look at yours. You challenge them to do something out of their comfort zone, usually as indicated by a lack of a certain style or genre of image in their stream.\n\nThey do the same with you. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1681475@N24/\">www.flickr.com/groups/1681475@N24/</a>  Get Pushed\n\n(Note: 9/20. And damn, &quot;Explore - #73&quot; was the last thing on my mind. I just wished to complete the challenge with an acceptable entry).\n\nI think you get 5 to 8 days to complete the task assigned to you. I was challenged to do a &quot;classic water drop.&quot; I went away for some seminars this weekend and was running out of time. So I cheated...a bit...kinda'. These are water drops shown above, just not the classic &quot;lands in liquid and creates all of those drops of water into something&quot; shapes. \n\nMy partner is Jay Banks - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21395822@N05/\">www.flickr.com/photos/21395822@N05/</a> - and I challneged him to do an hdr image.\n\nAs for me, I found this left over lemon in the garbage. I thought it might make an interesting bowl to receive water drops. It didn't: the water drops got lost in the lemony-yellow meat of the fruit. (I woulda' preferred a cherry or a peach, but I didn't have any).\n\nNonetheless, I'm on a bit of a lemon roll photographically here, although I think this is it, (oddly enough, I now have a taste for lemon pastries). I also have a sink, a decent faucet, black plates, a black, cardboard backdrop, a small, 8x10&quot; white, plastic cutting board for bounce flash fill, and a nikon strobe (held off the camera). 90mm, f2.8 Sigma macro lens. \n\nNO texture used here!!! :-)))) Processed for color, contrast, etc., but otherwise, straight out of the camera.\n\nIt was surprising to me that it only took about 60 shots to get four, useable &quot;dangling drops&quot; images ( I thought I was gonna' be up all night). I could tell when I got it as the drops &quot;froze in air&quot; - to my regular eyes - when the strobe caught them right. Then it was a matter of me timing the drops.\n\nThe seminars I attended were &quot;personal development&quot; types.

Designed by William Adair Bugge (July 10, 1900 - November 14, 1992), construction of the cantilever truss bridge was completed by the DeLong Corporation, the American Bridge Company, and Pomeroy Gerwick.\n\nPedestrians are prohibited from the bridge except during the annual bridge walk called the &quot;Great Columbia Crossing&quot;. Bicycles are permitted on the bridge in both Oregon and Washington.

Madrid\nArquitecto Rafael de La-Hoz Castanys 2005-08\n\nEl Palacete de don Eduardo Adcoch, construido por el arquitecto José López Sallaberry, entre 1905 y 1906,  se sitúa en el Paseo de la Castellana nº 37 con vuelta a las calles de a Rafael Calvo y Fortuny, en una zona formada por el eje de las calles Almagro-Miguel Ángel y Paseo de la Castellana, donde la aristocracia madrileña sitúa sus palacetes a finales del siglo XIX y comienzos del XX. Construido siguiendo la moda de la época, al estilo de los “hoteles” franceses, si bien presenta elementos ornamentales propios de la arquitectura del renacimiento español. En 1999, el palacete se convierte en la sede de la Fundación Rafael del Pino, fundador y presidente de la constructora Ferrovial, encargándose su rehabilitación al arquitecto Rafael de La Hoz. En 2005, sobre el jardín, se encarga a Rafael de La Hoz la ampliación del edificio, incluyendo el nuevo auditorio, que, en palabras del arquitecto se trata de la “transformación de un jardín en un jardín habitado”. \nEl Auditorio Rafael del Pino, obra de Rafael de La-Hoz, es una expresión, fuerte y delicada a la vez, de la arquitectura que utiliza la tecnología del vidrio para materializar la poética propuesta del “jardín habitado”. Se propone la realización de unas fachadas “etéreas” en cristal transparente e incoloro, en contraposición con la fuerte geometría y dimensiones de los pilares arbóreos que sustentan el edificio exteriormente; así, lo primero que se aprecia es la presencia de los “árboles” de acero que constituyen la estructura portante de la cual “cuelgan” los forjados sin apoyos intermedios. Tras la estructura arbórea se ubica el cerramiento construido en vidrio neutro, sin tintar. Las fachadas abiertas a las vías públicas son de cristal, planas y verticales, mientras que la opuesta a la calle Fortuny, hacia la medianera, se inclina con una suave curvatura para adaptarse al galibo requerido por la normativa. Finalmente, la orientada hacia el palacete presenta una configuración pétrea y más cerrada. El doble acristalamiento es una óptima solución desde el punto de vista ambiental que permite el aprovechamiento de la energía solar que recibe. En su interior, sus espacios diáfanos, sin pilares interiores, y el empleo de los materiales más exquisitos, crean un ambiente muy especial. El auditorio cuenta con aforo para 250 personas.","author":"javier1949","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21762338@N02/6164123048","pop":44,"lat":40.4343,"lng":-3.68979,"mdsy":0.276552,"mdsx":0.293615,"tags":"madrid arquitectura árboles edificio auditorio castellana cristal vidrio jardín palacete transparente acero estructura neutro rafaeldelahoz ampliación incoloro lópezsallaberry fundaciónrafaeldelpino adcoch edificiofortuny","color":"#aeb5ba","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6164123048_1eb76601f7_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":10000,"w":100,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6164123048_1eb76601f7_t.jpg","s":100},{"a":57600,"w":240,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6164123048_1eb76601f7_m.jpg","s":240},{"a":250000,"w":500,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6164123048_1eb76601f7.jpg","s":500},{"a":409600,"w":640,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6164123048_1eb76601f7_z.jpg","s":640},{"a":1048576,"w":1024,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6164123048_1eb76601f7_b.jpg","s":1024},{"a":6718464,"w":2592,"h":2592,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6164123048_5e644b6db9_o.jpg","s":2592}]},{"id":6163968428,"published":1316463040,"title":"Dunstanburgh (Explored Sept 19th 2011) :-)","text":"Went back to one of my favourite places for a retake of this shot from Embleton Bay.\n\nf16 for 80 secs @ISO100\nLee Big Stopper\nLee 0.9ND soft grad","author":"Dougie Williams","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/53307567@N08/6163968428","pop":113,"lat":55.4934,"lng":-1.60126,"mdsy":-0.0104508,"mdsx":0.438072,"tags":"longexposure castle beach rock landscape explore northumberland northumbria lee stacking stopper longexposures dunstanburgh bythesea explored northumberlandlandscapesgeotagged nd10stop leebigstopper musselburghcameraclub","color":"#596b97","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6163968428_aa6b57abf2_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6400,"w":100,"h":64,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6163968428_aa6b57abf2_t.jpg","s":80},{"a":36720,"w":240,"h":153,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6163968428_aa6b57abf2_m.jpg","s":192},{"a":159500,"w":500,"h":319,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6163968428_aa6b57abf2.jpg","s":399},{"a":261760,"w":640,"h":409,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6163968428_aa6b57abf2_z.jpg","s":512},{"a":669696,"w":1024,"h":654,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6163968428_aa6b57abf2_b.jpg","s":818},{"a":1251600,"w":1400,"h":894,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6163968428_51fe9c79e3_o.jpg","s":1119}]},{"id":6162972641,"published":1316453918,"title":"Vatersay Walkway","text":"The path to the white sands of Queens Beach on Vartersay, the Hebridean Isle now linked to Barra by a causeway.

My first ever ad in a National Magazine named BARK at your newsstands now, page 93!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe ad is for Azaya Ranch Sanctuary a wonderful place that takes animals no one else wants and rehabilitates them so that they become adoptable and if they can't adopt them out then they live their life out at the ranch.\n\nMany shelters and rescues need photographers to help photograph their animals and get them adopted and it has been proven that good pictures do get the attention of potential adopters.  Also in this issue of BARK is an article of a wonderful group called <a href=\"http://heartsspeak.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">heartsspeak.org/</a> a group of photographers who lend their time and skills  to shelters.  If you want to hone your photo skills and work with the most beautiful supermodels an animal shelter or rescue is a wonderful place to be.","author":"sunmallia","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23809768@N08/6162370735","pop":32,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":0.11592,"mdsx":-0.348511,"tags":"","color":"#a3a54e","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162370735_9db40f7d61_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":7800,"w":78,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162370735_9db40f7d61_t.jpg","s":88},{"a":44640,"w":186,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162370735_9db40f7d61_m.jpg","s":211},{"a":194000,"w":388,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162370735_9db40f7d61.jpg","s":440},{"a":318080,"w":497,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162370735_9db40f7d61_z.jpg","s":564},{"a":814080,"w":795,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6162370735_9db40f7d61_b.jpg","s":902}]},{"id":6162058599,"published":1316434134,"title":"Fields,

Doug was a devoted husband and father of two lovely children Stephen and Melissa.\n\nDoug was an uncomplicated fellow, an excellent tradesman, and a mad keen fisherman.  Every photo I have of Doug shows him in a straw hat holding a huge fish.\n\nDoug passed away 6 days ago at the age of 56 years, from pancreatic cancer.  We will all miss his wonderful good nature","author":"kewelldude","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/56130462@N04/6161882789","pop":40,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":0.31321,"mdsx":-0.0179776,"tags":"","color":"#f0f0f0","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6161882789_101b872716_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6800,"w":100,"h":68,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6161882789_101b872716_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":39120,"w":240,"h":163,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6161882789_101b872716_m.jpg","s":198},{"a":169500,"w":500,"h":339,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6161882789_101b872716.jpg","s":412},{"a":277760,"w":640,"h":434,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6161882789_101b872716_z.jpg","s":527},{"a":389612,"w":758,"h":514,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6161882789_101b872716_b.jpg","s":624}]},{"id":6161664609,"published":1316422445,"title":"Luz y sombra     [ Explore ]","text":"<a href=\"http://www.goear.com/listen/9f89296/what-about-now-daughtry\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.goear.com/listen/9f89296/what-about-now-daughtry</a>","author":"Bluemed - On/Off","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/52389012@N05/6161664609","pop":127,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":-0.0149092,"mdsx":-0.628424,"tags":"","color":"#3a6ec4","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6161664609_29f6a6d624_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6161664609_29f6a6d624_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6161664609_29f6a6d624_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6161664609_29f6a6d624.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6161664609_29f6a6d624_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6161664609_29f6a6d624_b.jpg","s":836},{"a":15054336,"w":4752,"h":3168,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6161664609_cdd73199e6_o.jpg","s":3880}]},{"id":6164324012,"published":1316470102,"title":"La bici de Pisa","text":"Una tarde en Pisa (25/07/2011)\n\nTexturas: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/13796443@N05/6146063837/in/photostream\">osolev</a> + <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/13796443@N05/6163431457/in/photostream/\">osolev</a>","author":"osolev","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/13796443@N05/6164324012","pop":33,"lat":43.7227,"lng":10.3963,"mdsy":0.300548,"mdsx":-0.216859,"tags":"italy bike bicycle vintage europa europe italia bicicleta pisa bici toscana velo italie textured osolev","color":"#b9bb73","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6164324012_3c7b329709_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":10000,"w":100,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6164324012_3c7b329709_t.jpg","s":100},{"a":57600,"w":240,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6164324012_3c7b329709_m.jpg","s":240},{"a":250000,"w":500,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6164324012_3c7b329709.jpg","s":500},{"a":409600,"w":640,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6164324012_3c7b329709_z.jpg","s":640},{"a":1048576,"w":1024,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6164324012_3c7b329709_b.jpg","s":1024},{"a":6250000,"w":2500,"h":2500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6164324012_7c033cfecc_o.jpg","s":2500}]},{"id":6164253377,"published":1316480878,"title":"262/365","text":"The Little Prince.

He wanted his larger paintings to envelop and overwhelm, with sensuous colors that would act as a doorway into another, transcendent reality.  Here, the fiery orange has a velvety texture, with light and heavy brushstrokes layered to create a luminous effect.  Whereas the orange field seems to explode into the viewer’s space, the more uniformly applied twilight blue creates the sense of a receding vortex.  The two colors thus are not only formally balanced, but are also optical complements in the visual spectrum, contrasting and intensifying each other.  Between these two extremes, the rich, warm eggplant background gently mediates the expansion and the contraction of the other colors at their blurred perimeters.  The grand scale of the canvas heightens the dramatic interplay even more forcefully.\nFrom the placard:  San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\nHelen Cocker Russell Fund purchase, \n97.524\n","author":"rverc","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/26270547@N07/6164537960","pop":33,"lat":null,"lng":null,"mdsy":0.13465,"mdsx":-0.419712,"tags":"sanfrancisco art sfmoma markrothko","color":"#bb5d2d","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6164537960_f1edd901a5_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":9300,"w":93,"h":100,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6164537960_f1edd901a5_t.jpg","s":96},{"a":53520,"w":223,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6164537960_f1edd901a5_m.jpg","s":231},{"a":232500,"w":465,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6164537960_f1edd901a5.jpg","s":482},{"a":380800,"w":595,"h":640,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6164537960_f1edd901a5_z.jpg","s":617},{"a":974848,"w":952,"h":1024,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6164537960_f1edd901a5_b.jpg","s":987},{"a":5175646,"w":2194,"h":2359,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6164537960_36664e555a_o.jpg","s":2275}]},{"id":6164453666,"published":1316472955,"title":"50?","text":"that must be some table.","author":"xgray","link":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/88345903@N00/6164453666","pop":130,"lat":30.3171,"lng":-97.7199,"mdsy":0.151191,"mdsx":-0.0825628,"tags":"leica color film analog zeiss 35mm austin table texas kodak driveway 100 m7 ektar zm northloop 50forsale","color":"#91806c","s":75,"images":[{"a":5625,"w":75,"h":75,"t":1,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6164453666_2716533fdd_s.jpg","s":75},{"a":6700,"w":100,"h":67,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6164453666_2716533fdd_t.jpg","s":82},{"a":38400,"w":240,"h":160,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6164453666_2716533fdd_m.jpg","s":196},{"a":166500,"w":500,"h":333,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6164453666_2716533fdd.jpg","s":408},{"a":273280,"w":640,"h":427,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6164453666_2716533fdd_z.jpg","s":523},{"a":699392,"w":1024,"h":683,"t":0,"url":"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6164453666_2716533fdd_b.jpg","s":836}]},{"id":6164394893,"published":1316484036,"title":"I like some pirate booty!","text":"Argh Mateys!
