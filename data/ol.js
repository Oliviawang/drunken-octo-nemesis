It is the last novel in the Prairie trilogy, preceded by O Pioneers! and The Song of the Lark.My Antonia tells the stories of several immigrant families who move out to rural Nebraska to start new lives in America, with a particular focus on a Bohemian family, the Shimerdas, whose eldest daughter is named Antonia. The book's narrator, Jim Burden, arrives in the fictional town of Black Hawk, Nebraska, on the same train as the Shimerdas, as he goes to live with his grandparents after his parents have died. Jim develops strong feelings for Antonia, something between a crush and a filial bond, and the reader views Antonia's life, including its attendant struggles and triumphs, through that lens.","author":"Willa Cather","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL12791W","pop":58,"lat":41.5,"lng":-99.751,"mdsy":-0.0148616,"mdsx":-0.00592595,"tags":"Friendship in fiction, Farmers' spouses, Fiction in English, Women immigrants, OverDrive, Nebraska in fiction, Married women in fiction, Farmers' spouses in fiction, Farm life in fiction, Classic Literature, Frontier and pioneer life in fiction, Frontier and pioneer life, Women immigrants in fiction, Literature, Czech Americans, Women pioneers, Fiction, Friendship, Women pioneers in fiction, Czech Americans in fiction, Married women, Farm life, Love stories","color":"#9abdb9","s":46,"images":[{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5291487-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":25984,"w":128,"h":203,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5291487-L.jpg","s":161}],"year":1918},{"id":15723140,"published":-220924800,"title":"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold","text":"Set in East Germany at the height of the Cold War, just after the Berlin Wall was built, and introducing a hitherto unknown realism into the espionage novel, Publishers Weekly called this book the best spy novel ever written.","author":"John le Carré","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL15723140W","pop":40,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":0.00638398,"mdsx":0.00841726,"tags":"Cold War, Intelligence officers, Juvenile fiction, Fiction, Intelligence service, English Spy stories, Large type books, Spies, Accessible book","color":"#7a642f","s":44,"images":[{"a":1914,"w":33,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6565094-S.jpg","s":44},{"a":55980,"w":180,"h":311,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6565094-M.jpg","s":237},{"a":144500,"w":289,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6565094-L.jpg","s":380}],"year":1963},{"id":12830,"published":-1514764800,"title":"One of ours","text":"Claude Wheeler opened his eyes before the sun was up and vigorously shook his younger brother, who lay in the other half of the same bed.  \"Ralph, Ralph, get awake!

They have been friends since their childhood in France and their mission includes the correction of backsliding priests and the restoration of the Catholic culture. Themes of Indian relations, slavery, heresy, insubordinate clerical conduct, and reclusiveness are presented for Latour's and Vaillant's examination. Latour is dignified and reflective while Vaillant is forthright and optimistic; together they're able to appreciate a simple life in the southwestern desert which has become an oasis of civilization. Latour's commitment to erect a cathedral in the wilderness is realized after nearly forty years of good works in these reverential surroundings. His devotion to his assignment and the wisdom he secures from his inner conflicts are the qualities that sustain him even while his youth drains away. Cather beautifully and powerfully portrays the harmony that results from steadfast purpose.

Set in the reign of Queen Anne, the story follows the troubled progress of a gentleman and an officer in Marlborough's army, as he painfully wrestles with an emotional allegiance to the old Tory-Catholic England until, disillusioned, he comes to terms of a kind with the Whiggish-Protestant future. This change also entails a very uncomfortable switch in his affections.

But here Thackeray plunders his own past to create the character of Pendennis and the world in which he lives: from miserable schoolboy to striving journalist, from carefree Oxbridge to the high (and low) life of London. The result is a superbly panoramic blend of people, action and background. The true ebb and flow of life is caught and the credibility of Pen, his worldly uncle, the Major, and many of the other characters, extends far beyond the pages of the novel. Held together by Thackeray's flowing, confident prose, with its conversational ease of tone, Pendennis is as rich a portrait of England in the 1830s and 40s as it is a thorough and thoroughly entertaining self-portrait.","author":"William Makepeace Thackeray","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16311W","pop":68,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":-0.00578272,"mdsx":0.000194278,"tags":"Accessible book, Young men in fiction, Fiction, Great Britain in fiction, Young men, History","color":"#a7975b","s":45,"images":[{"a":2030,"w":35,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/103044-S.jpg","s":45},{"a":53460,"w":180,"h":297,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/103044-M.jpg","s":231},{"a":136325,"w":287,"h":475,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/103044-L.jpg","s":369}],"year":1848},{"id":16312,"published":-3692131200,"title":"The Newcomes","text":"The Newcomes is Thackeray's most essentially 'Victorian' novel, generous in its proportions, sharp in its criticism of the moral convolutions of the age, and encyclopaedic in its reference. Set in the 1830s and 1840s, a period of rapid change and of political and economic development, the novel considers the fortunes and misfortunes of a 'most respectable' extended middle-class family. The action moves from London to Brighton, from England to France, from the political ambitions of an older generation in the industrial North to the painterly pretensions of a younger generation in Italy. At its centre is Thomas Newcome, a retired Colonel in the Indian Army who finds the snobberies and hypocrisies of early Victorian England disconcerting. In a world of men on the make, of social mobility, and of the buying and selling of women in an aristocratic marriage market, it is the Colonel's distinctive but old-fashioned gentlemanliness that stands out from a self-seeking society. The most observant and witty among Thackeray's studies of his culture, The Newcomes is also among his most complex and allusive novels, and this edition provides particularly detailed notes which clarify his many references.","author":"William Makepeace Thackeray","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16312W","pop":76,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":-0.00361572,"mdsx":0.00274109,"tags":"Families, Family, Families in fiction, Accessible book, Fiction, Protected DAISY, Family in fiction, Domestic fiction","color":"#fafafa","s":158,"images":[{"a":24832,"w":128,"h":194,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4647324-M.jpg","s":158},{"a":2204,"w":38,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4647324-S.jpg","s":47}],"year":1853},{"id":16313,"published":-5364662400,"title":"Vanity Fair","text":"Vanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero is William Thackeray's celebrated satirical novel of 19th century British society.

It cast its eyes upon the roads, which were growing from long troughs of liquid mud to proper thoroughfares. A river, amber-tinted in the shadow of its banks, purled at the army's feet; and at night, when the stream had become of a sorrowful blackness, one could see across it the red, eye-like gleam of hostile camp-fires set in the low brows of distant hills.\r\nA very dramatic novel recounting the experiences of a young recruit from New York during the American Civil War. During his first battle the young soldier deserts his post and makes his way to the rear. Overcome with shame at his own cowardice he returns to his unit and eventually performs heroically.

Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new, rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives, nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness, enveloped by a mysterious darkness. First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.","author":"John Steinbeck","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL23166W","pop":45,"lat":36.678,"lng":-121.656,"mdsy":-0.0193259,"mdsx":0.00679974,"tags":"Hermanos, Padre e hijo, Protected DAISY, Brothers, Accessible book, Rivaldad entre hermanos, Children of prostitutes, Fathers and sons, Fiction, Novela histórica, OverDrive, Twins, Niños de prostitutas, Domestic fiction, Ficción, Classic Literature, Novela hogareña, Sibling rivalry, Rural families","color":"#a3b6bf","s":50,"images":[{"a":2494,"w":43,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/854773-S.jpg","s":50},{"a":43200,"w":180,"h":240,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/854773-M.jpg","s":208},{"a":169100,"w":356,"h":475,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/854773-L.jpg","s":411}],"year":1952},{"id":23196,"published":-1167609600,"title":"To a God unknown","text":"As his father lies dying, Joseph Wayne decides to trade his Vermont farm for a new life in California.

Beginning ten years after Little Men, Jo's Boys revisits Plumfield, the New England school still presided over by Jo and her husband, Professor Bhaer. Jo's boys--including rebellious Dan, sailor Emil, and promising musicain Nat--are grown; Jo herself remains at the center of this tale, holding her boys fast through shipwreck and storm, disappointment ... and even murder. Popular for more than a century, the series that began with Little Women continues to hold universal appeal with its powerful and affectionate depiction of family--the safe haven where the prodigal can always return, adversity is never met alone, and our dreams of being cherished, no matter what our flaws, come true.","author":"Louisa May Alcott","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL29979W","pop":48,"lat":46.478,"lng":-102.843,"mdsy":-0.0112117,"mdsx":0.00880389,"tags":"In library, Classic Literature, Family, New England in fiction, Juvenile fiction, Protected DAISY, Family life, Schools in fiction, Fiction, Family life in fiction, OverDrive, Boarding schools, Schools, Boarding schools in fiction, Accessible book, Lending library","color":"#961f12","s":45,"images":[{"a":2030,"w":35,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/368569-S.jpg","s":45},{"a":53100,"w":180,"h":295,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/368569-M.jpg","s":230},{"a":137275,"w":289,"h":475,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/368569-L.jpg","s":371}],"year":1886},{"id":30060,"published":-3376598400,"title":"Hospital Sketches","text":"From the book:So far, very good.

A favorite of the queen, Orlando is given a vast estate by the aging monarch and instructed to never to grow old.  He doesn't, and Woolf's novel follows him through the centuries, across the globe, through all sorts of love affairs and intrigues, and through his transformation into a woman.\r\n\r\nThe novel has been famously described by Nigel Nicolson as \"the longest and most charming love letter in literature\"-and for good reason.  Orlando is dedicated to [Victoria Sackville-West][1], who also provided the inspiration for Woolf's androgynous protagonist.  Sackville-West was a novelist and poet, and some of her works were published by Virginia and Leonard Woolf's Hogarth Press.  Woolf met her in 1923, and the two had a passionate relationship that lasted for almost two decades.  Although Sackville-West's affairs were public and quite scandalous, she was also very much a genteel British aristocrat.  For her part, Woolf admired Sackville-West's androgyny, a quality which she famously praises in her work [A Room of One's Own][2]. \r\n\r\nUnique and fantastical, Orlando is Woolf's most light-hearted work, and it is stylistically perhaps her most straightforward.  Eschewing stream-of-consciousness and other more experimental narrative techniques that are found in her [To the Lighthouse][3] and [Mrs. Dalloway][4], Woolf often uses a largely unadorned style and a third-person narrator, often to effectively parody the male-dominated writing of the nineteenth century.  \r\n\r\nOrlando was published in 1928 during one of most daring and impressive periods of achievement and development in English literary history.  Indeed, not since the heyday of English Romanticism in the early nineteenth century, have so many enduring and groundbreaking masterworks been produced.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://openlibrary.org/authors/OL137459A/Vita_Sackville-West\r\n  [2]: http://openlibrary.org/works/OL39379W/Room_of_one%27s_own\r\n  [3]: http://openlibrary.org/works/OL39396W/To_the_Lighthouse\r\n  [4]: http://openlibrary.org/works/OL39349W/Mrs._Dalloway","author":"Virginia Woolf","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL39360W","pop":111,"lat":52.16,"lng":-0.703,"mdsy":-0.0184596,"mdsx":-0.000540637,"tags":"Nobility in fiction, Gender identity in fiction, Fiction, England in fiction, Transsexuals, Sex role in fiction, Characters and characteristics in literature, Textual Criticism, Literature, Mujeres, Hombres, Men, Facsimiles, OverDrive, Historia, English Manuscripts, Manuscripts, Women, Transsexuals in fiction, Women in fiction, Sackville-West, V. in fiction, Men in fiction, Nobility, History, England, Characters and characteristics in literature in fiction, Sex role, Ficción, Gender identity","color":"#803e19","s":46,"images":[{"a":2146,"w":37,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/903615-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":50040,"w":180,"h":278,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/903615-M.jpg","s":224},{"a":161500,"w":323,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/903615-L.jpg","s":402}],"year":1928},{"id":39396,"published":-1356998400,"title":"To the Lighthouse","text":"This novel is an extraordinarily poignant evocation of a lost happiness that lives on in the memory.

In some ways, \"portrait\" is not an entirely appropriate word, because Woolf's subject in this novel (and an abiding concern in  all of her works) is fluidity and flux: the movement of the seasons and years, the experience of maturing and growing old, and the pain of change, passing, and loss.  Although it spans a fifty year period, it is not an epic novel in the sense that Mann's [*Buddenbrooks*][1] or Tolstoy's [*War and Peace*][2] are epic.  The fifty years under consideration in *The Years* are not continuously narrated; instead, the novel deals with only certain years-1880, 1891, 1908, 1911, 1914, 1917 and \"The Present Day\" - punctuated with large gaps of time in between.  At each new juncture, the reader is left to surmise what has happened in the intervening time with little assistance from a controlling narrative presence. \r\n\r\nAlthough *The Years* is written in the third person, the novel's narrative voice roves among the point of view of different characters fluidly, and recounts the events of the past through memory and dialogue rather than through a third-person summation.  Leaping over years and even decades - as the novel does - infuses it with a sense of time's rapid, relentless movement, as the reader watches characters age significantly with the turn of a few pages. The subject matter of *The Years* is also decidedly not epic, but it is what gives the novel its remarkable power.  Although it does discuss what might be termed monumental events in the lives of its characters, such as the death of Mrs. Pargiter in the first chapter, the novel leaves out many events that might seem particularly noteworthy, such as the birth of a child, a courtship, or a wedding.  These traditional milestones are often consigned to the blank, unnarrated stretches of time that pass between the chapters.   Woolf instead focuses our attention on smaller, less self-evidently significant moments of experience:  a girl writing a letter to her brother, a college student sipping a glass of port and studying ancient Greek, the goodnights exchanged after a dinner party.  These tiny moments exist in a tension against the sweep of seasons, years, and lives passing in the background, and this ever-present tension is what makes the novel ultimately so disquieting and so moving.  Not only does the book's structure keep us constantly aware of the time's march, but also many of the smaller details - the sound of cars moving in the streets, the sight of a hearth fire dying, a gust of wind and rain - subtly keep an atmosphere of change, flow, and passing defining the experience of the characters.  The things that lend a sense of fixity to life, such as rank, employment, or marriage, or those things that pass for it, such as a painting, a text, or a sentimentalized object, are touchstones for Woolf as well.  The discord between the desire for stasis and the inevitability of change in many ways defines the novel, and is everywhere evidenced in the very environment in which the characters live and breathe.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://openlibrary.org/works/OL14867081W/Buddenbrooks\r\n  [2]: http://openlibrary.org/works/OL267129W/Vo%C4%ADna_i_mir","author":"Virginia Woolf","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL39575W","pop":54,"lat":51.509,"lng":-0.126,"mdsy":-0.00966272,"mdsx":0.00470262,"tags":"Social life and customs, In library, Families, Family, Families in fiction, Accessible book, Translations, Fiction, England in fiction, Protected DAISY, Family in fiction, History","color":"#a39495","s":47,"images":[{"a":2204,"w":38,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/116636-S.jpg","s":47},{"a":48960,"w":180,"h":272,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/116636-M.jpg","s":221},{"a":149150,"w":314,"h":475,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/116636-L.jpg","s":386}],"year":1937},{"id":39578,"published":-1735689600,"title":"The Voyage Out","text":"From the book: As the streets that lead from the Strand to the Embankment are very narrow, it is better not to walk down them arm-in-arm. If you persist, lawyers’ clerks will have to make flying leaps into the mud; young lady typists will have to fidget behind you. In the streets of London where beauty goes unregarded, eccentricity must pay the penalty, and it is better not to be very tall, to wear a long blue cloak, or to beat the air with your left hand. One afternoon in the beginning of October when the traffic was becoming brisk a tall man strode along the edge of the pavement with a lady on his arm. Angry glances struck upon their backs. The small, agitated figures - for in comparison with this couple most people looked small - decorated with fountain pens, and burdened with despatch-boxes, had appointments to keep, and drew a weekly salary, so that there was some reason for the unfriendly stare which was bestowed upon Mr. Ambrose’s height and upon Mrs. Ambrose’s cloak. But some enchantment had put both man and woman beyond the reach of malice and unpopularity. In his guess one might guess from the moving lips that it was thought; and in hers from the eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a level above the eyes of most that it was sorrow. It was only by scorning all she met that she kept herself from tears, and the friction of people brushing past her was evidently painful. After watching the traffic on the Embankment for a minute or two with a stoical gaze she twitched her husband’s sleeve, and they crossed between the swift discharge of motor cars. When they were safe on the further side, she gently withdrew her arm from his, allowing her mouth at the same time to relax, to tremble; then tears rolled down, and leaning her elbows on the balustrade, she shielded her face from the curious. Mr. Ambrose attempted consolation; he patted her shoulder; but she showed no signs of admitting him, and feeling it awkward to stand beside a grief that was greater than his, he crossed his arms behind him, and took a turn along the pavement.","author":"Virginia Woolf","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL39578W","pop":64,"lat":-14.605,"lng":-57.656,"mdsy":-0.0168424,"mdsx":-0.00203868,"tags":"Man-woman relationships, British in fiction, Women travelers, Ocean travel, Classic Literature, Travel, Women in fiction, British, Fiction, Women travelers in fiction, OverDrive, Young women in fiction, Protected DAISY, Social conditions, Young women, Man-woman relationships in fiction, Ocean travel in fiction, Accessible book, Women","color":"#aab3ad","s":47,"images":[{"a":2204,"w":38,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/756361-S.jpg","s":47},{"a":166500,"w":333,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/756361-L.jpg","s":408},{"a":48600,"w":180,"h":270,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/756361-M.jpg","s":220}],"year":1915},{"id":40252,"published":-2934748800,"title":"Black Beauty","text":"Told by the magnificent black horse himself, this is the dramatic and heartwarming tale of Black Beauty's life-from his idyllic days on a country squire's estate to his harsh fate as a London cab horse.","author":"Anna Sewell","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL40252W","pop":125,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":-0.00699014,"mdsx":0.0144866,"tags":"Horses, Legends and stories, Animals, Folklore, Toy and movable books, Juvenile Literature, Juvenile fiction, Fiction, Novela juvenil, Accessible book, OverDrive, Juvenile sound recordings, Horses in fiction, Great Britain in fiction, Classic Literature, Specimens, Caballos, History","color":"#b6a373","s":49,"images":[{"a":2378,"w":41,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4345467-S.jpg","s":49},{"a":23296,"w":128,"h":182,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4345467-M.jpg","s":153}],"year":1877},{"id":40962,"published":-4165516800,"title":"Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym","text":"\"So tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man...\"A stowaway aboard the whaling ship Grampus, Arthur Gordon Pym finds himself bound on an extraordinary voyage to the high southern latitudes.

That, however, was thirteen years ago, and, in respect of the first opinion, I venture to think that those who care to read the story now will be quite astonished at the scrupulous propriety observed therein on the relations of the sexes; for though there may be frivolous, and even grotesque touches on occasion, there is hardly a single caress in the book outside legal matrimony, or what was intended so to be.","author":"Thomas Hardy","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL44985W","pop":62,"lat":50.717,"lng":-1.886,"mdsy":-0.0072977,"mdsx":-0.00365237,"tags":"Classic Literature, Adultery, Social classes in fiction, Accessible book, Fiction, OverDrive, Astronomical observatories in fiction, Astronomical observatories, Social classes, Adultery in fiction","color":"#9ca3a7","s":46,"images":[{"a":2146,"w":37,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/103372-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":49860,"w":180,"h":277,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/103372-M.jpg","s":223},{"a":162000,"w":324,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/103372-L.jpg","s":402}],"year":1800},{"id":44986,"published":-2366755200,"title":"Jude the Obscure","text":"Hardy's last work of fiction, Jude the Obscure is also one of his most gloomily fatalistic, depicting the lives of individuals who are trapped by forces beyond their control. Jude Fawley, a poor villager, wants to enter the divinity school at Christminster. Sidetracked by Arabella Donn, an earthy country girl who pretends to be pregnant by him, Jude marries her and is then deserted. He earns a living as a stonemason at Christminster; there he falls in love with his independent-minded cousin, Sue Bridehead. Out of a sense of obligation, Sue marries the schoolmaster Phillotson, who has helped her. Unable to bear living with Phillotson, she returns to live with Jude and eventually bears his children out of wedlock. Their poverty and the weight of society's disapproval begin to take a toll on Sue and Jude; the climax occurs when Jude's son by Arabella hangs Sue and Jude's children and himself. In penance, Sue returns to Phillotson and the church. Jude returns to Arabella and eventually dies miserably. The novel's sexual frankness shocked the public, as did Hardy's criticisms of marriage, the university system, and the church. Hardy was so distressed by its reception that he wrote no more fiction, concentrating solely on his poetry.Please Note:  This book is easy to read in true text, not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher.

To restore the grey carcases of a mediaevalism whose spirit had fled, seemed a not less incongruous act than to set about renovating the adjoining crags themselves.

His young life is full of educational moments: he appears in a class production of The Round Table as a juvenile Lancelot in unexpected make-up and tights; he uses his Sunday school money to buy a bag of candy and a movie ticket; his attendance at Friday Afternoon Dance Class is in opposition to his summer night questing excursions; he is blamed when his sister's dress is found in the doghouse. Because he is desirous of being indecipherable, he practices a mysterious and unemotional expression. He knows \"the world\" would misunderstand \"everything\" about him, so an instinct for self-preservation persuades him to give society as little evidence as possible to convict him. His most calm and honest occasions are spent with his dog Duke, a thoughtful scraggly dog who is almost unwillingly loyal. \"Penrod\" is an incredible story, enlightening and profound and genuinely comical.","author":"Booth Tarkington","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL54904W","pop":37,"lat":40,"lng":-86.25,"mdsy":-0.00395512,"mdsx":0.000230678,"tags":"Accessible book, Boys in fiction, Fiction, Boys, OverDrive, Classic Literature, Indiana in fiction","color":"#ede6cc","s":46,"images":[{"a":2146,"w":37,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5680920-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":49860,"w":180,"h":277,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5680920-M.jpg","s":223},{"a":162000,"w":324,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5680920-L.jpg","s":402}],"year":1914},{"id":55151,"published":-4828204800,"title":"Adolphe","text":"Adolphe is a privileged and refined young man, bored by the stupidity he perceives in the world around him.

I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again. I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of these questions in this book. In most books, the I, or first person, is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism, is the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after all, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers, they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.","author":"Henry David Thoreau","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL55649W","pop":236,"lat":42.439,"lng":-71.34,"mdsy":-0.0264075,"mdsx":0.0158856,"tags":"Civil disobedience, English essays, Accessible book, In library, American Authors, Indexes, OverDrive, 1817-1862, Essays, Juvenile literature, Translations into Chinese, Philosophy, Massachusetts, Classic Literature, Comic books, strips, Natural history, Fiction, Social life and customs, Resistance to Government, Solitude, Wildnerness areas, Wilderness areas, Walden Woods, Homes and haunts, Nonfiction, Protected DAISY, Biography","color":"#e9ddbb","s":43,"images":[{"a":1856,"w":32,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5666431-S.jpg","s":43},{"a":57600,"w":180,"h":320,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5666431-M.jpg","s":240},{"a":140500,"w":281,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5666431-L.jpg","s":375}],"year":1854},{"id":55670,"published":-3818361600,"title":"A week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers","text":"Thoreau's account of his 1839 boat trip is a finely crafted tapestry of travel writing, essays, and lyrical poetry.

They were unaware that Washington Irving had invented the man entirely and placed the ads himself. Knickerbocker's purported manuscript, A History of New York, was Irving's own. Told from Knickerbocker's point of view, A History of New York is a chronicle of New York's fifty years under Dutch rule in the 1600s that plays fast and loose with the facts, to uproarious effect. Irving's good-humored spoofing had staying power, and his satire provided the city with its first self-portrait.

Symbolism and intrigue abound as our hero finds himself chasing declaration of the next Pope through Rome and a series of grisly murders.\r\n\r\nGoodreads.com: Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is shocked to find proof that the legendary secret society, the Illuminati--dedicated since the time of Galileo to promoting the interests of science and condemning the blind faith of Catholicism--is alive, well, and murderously active. Brilliant physicist Leonardo Vetra has been murdered, his eyes plucked out, and the society's ancient symbol branded upon his chest. His final discovery, antimatter, the most powerful and dangerous energy source known to man, has disappeared--only to be hidden somewhere beneath Vatican City on the eve of the election of a new pope. Langdon and Vittoria, Vetra's daughter and colleague, embark on a frantic hunt through the streets, churches, and catacombs of Rome, following a 400-year-old trail to the lair of the Illuminati, to prevent the incineration of civilization.\r\n\r\nBrown seems as much juggler as author--there are lots and lots of balls in the air in this novel, yet Brown manages to hurl the reader headlong into an almost surreal suspension of disbelief. While the reader might wish for a little more sardonic humor from Langdon, and a little less bombastic philosophizing on the eternal conflict between religion and science, these are less fatal flaws than niggling annoyances--readers should have no trouble skimming past them and immersing themselves in a heck of a good read. \"Brain candy\" it may be, but my!

This group is comprised of the rough, semiliterate Ishmael and Esther Bush, now in their fifties; their numerous children, including seven grown sons; Esther's brother, Abiram White; Ellen Wade, a niece, whose bearing bespeaks a more refined background; and Dr. Obed Bat, an eccentric naturalist. In search of a camping place for the night, they are suddenly confronted by a colossal figure who momentarily fills them with superstitious awe. It is Natty Bumppo, whose form, greatly magnified by an optical illusion, is outlined against the setting sun on the horizon. Once a hunter and scout but now reduced in his old age to trapping, Natty is almost as startled as the newcomers by the encounter. It has been months since the octogenarIan has seen white people so far beyond the settlements.

Rendering Dante's terza rima into lyrical blank verse, Zappulla's translation makes accessible to the modern reader the journey of the famed Florentine poet Dante through the nine circles of hell. With Virgil at his side, the great poet descends through horrific landscapes of the damned--dark forests, boiling muck, and burning plains filled with unspeakable punishment, lamentation, and terror--depicted with gruesome detail unmatched in all literature. Richly annotated, this translation takes even the first-time reader on a truth-seeking journey whose imaginative and psychological discoveries make clear why this work persists at the heart of Western culture.\"If Dante's Inferno is a cautionary tale of the history of human depravity, it is also an amazingly complex narrative, treating timeless ethical themes, medieval philosophy and religion, tendentious political issues and deeply personal events.\"--San Diego Union-TribuneFrom the Trade Paperback edition.","author":"Dante Alighieri","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL93227W","pop":126,"lat":42.833,"lng":12.833,"mdsy":-0.0152212,"mdsx":0.0164392,"tags":"Italian literature, Bibliography, Knowledge, Accessible book, Poetry, Fiction, OverDrive, Illustrations, Lending library, Texts, Translations, Italian Pottery, Classic Literature, Italian poetry, Pictorial works, Genealogy, History and criticism, Hell in literature, History, Iconography, Translations into English, Sources, Protected DAISY, Hell, Esperanto","color":"#cdc197","s":202,"images":[{"a":40860,"w":180,"h":227,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5783994-M.jpg","s":202},{"a":2668,"w":46,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5783994-S.jpg","s":52},{"a":197500,"w":395,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5783994-L.jpg","s":444}],"year":1782},{"id":93840,"published":-2745446400,"title":"Une vie","text":"Jeanne, ayant fini ses malles, s'approcha de la fenetre, mais la pluie ne cessait pas.

He still has his mistress and his fortune, plans to divorce his wife, and leaves for Chicago to scout its possibilities for a future home. He has letters of introduction to the most influential people--a bank president named Mr. Addison, for a start. Cowperwood is presented to others--lawyers, businessmen, and judges. At this beginning not one of them knew he had been incarcerated, and he wondered if that knowledge would affect their attitude towards him. He finally confesses his recent history to Addison and decides to establish his new company in Chicago. He carefully and thoroughly scrutinizes the conditions for establishing a wealth that would be envied by powerful men and selfish women. \"The magnetizing power of fame is great.\" As Cowperwood climbs the glorified mountain and sets out to ultimately conquer this new world, his past foibles overcome him again--his desire for beautiful women, his acquisition of unbelievable wealth, his need to be accepted and understood and revered. His genius for social and financial manipulations fails him in politics. The ending is a philosophical overview of what has happened and what can happen to a man with a restless heart.","author":"Theodore Dreiser","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL100238W","pop":45,"lat":39.76,"lng":-98.5,"mdsy":-0.00201969,"mdsx":-0.00675377,"tags":"Firearms industry and trade, Success in business, Accessible book, Capitalists and financiers, Revenge, Fiction, OverDrive","color":"#d1c9b5","s":46,"images":[{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5682224-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":51300,"w":180,"h":285,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5682224-M.jpg","s":226},{"a":157500,"w":315,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5682224-L.jpg","s":397}],"year":1914},{"id":100239,"published":-2208988800,"title":"An American tragedy","text":"The classic depiction of the harsh realities of American life, the dark side of the American Dream, and one man's doomed pursuit of love and success...\"Mr. Dreiser is not imitative and belongs to no school.

A codicil to his will, however, left Orley Farm (near London) to his much younger second wife and infant son. The will and the codicil were in her handwriting, and there were three witnesses, one of whom was no longer alive. A bitterly fought court case confirmed the codicil.\r\n\r\nTwenty years pass. Lady Mason lives at Orley farm with her adult son, Lucius. Samuel Dockwrath, a tenant, is asked to leave by Lucius, who wants to try new intensive farming methods. Aggrieved, and knowing of the original case (John Kenneby, one of the codicil witnesses, had been an unsuccessful suitor of his wife Miriam Usbech), Dockwrath investigates and finds a second deed signed by the same witnesses on the same date, though they can remember signing only one. He travels to Groby Park in Yorkshire, where Joseph Mason the younger lives with his comically parsimonious wife, and persuades Mason to have Lady Mason prosecuted for forgery. The prosecution fails, but Lady Mason later confesses privately that she committed the forgery, and is prompted by conscience to give up the estate.\r\n\r\nThere are various subplots. The main one deals with a slowly unfolding romance between Felix Graham (a young and relatively poor barrister without family) and Madeline Staveley, daughter of Judge Stavely of Noningsby. Graham has a long-standing engagement to the penniless Mary Snow, whom he supports and educates while she is being “moulded” to be his wife.\r\n\r\nBetween the Staveleys at Alston and Orley Farm at Hamworth lies the Cleve, where Sir Peregrine Orme lives with his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Orme, and grandson, Peregrine. Sir Peregrine falls in love with Lady Mason and is briefly engaged to her, but she calls off the match when she realises the seriousness of the court case.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Furnival, another barrister, befriends Lady Mason, arousing the jealousy of his wife. His daughter, Sophia, has a brief relationship with Augustus Stavely and a brief engagement to Lucius Mason. Eventually Furnival and his wife are reconciled, and Sophia's engagement is dropped. Sophia is portrayed as an intelligent woman who writes comically skillful letters.","author":"Anthony Trollope","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL109869W","pop":42,"lat":51.617,"lng":-0.317,"mdsy":-0.0124356,"mdsx":0.000852875,"tags":"Social life and customs, Mothers and sons, England, Accessible book, In library, Fiction, Inheritance and succession, Protected DAISY, Forgers, Landowners","color":"#688ac2","s":47,"images":[{"a":2204,"w":38,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2866291-S.jpg","s":47},{"a":48600,"w":180,"h":270,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2866291-M.jpg","s":220},{"a":166500,"w":333,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2866291-L.jpg","s":408}],"year":1862},{"id":109870,"published":-5364662400,"title":"Phineas Redux","text":"In the fourth of the 'Palliser' stories, Trollope follows Phineas Finn's return to the dangerous world of Westminster politics.

In The Last Chronicle, Mr Crawley is accused of stealing when a cheque belonging to the Duke of Omnium, dropped by the Duke's steward during or after a visit to Mr. Crawley, is cashed by a tradesman to whom Mr. Crawley owes money at his bank. Mr. Crawley is unable to account for the money, and so is brought before the magistrates and committed for trial. The scandal this creates brings down upon him the redoubtable anger of Mrs Proudie, the bishop's wife. The important thing about Mr. Crawley, which makes him by far the most interesting character in the novel sequence, is that he has a tendency toward madness, which starts small - his absent-mindedness about money which makes it impossible to remember where the cheque came from - and grows, tormenting him and his family and friends.","author":"Anthony Trollope","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL109876W","pop":49,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":-0.0131372,"mdsx":-0.00167624,"tags":"Barsetshire (England : Imaginary place), Social life and customs, Clergy in fiction, Accessible book, Fiction, Romance, England in fiction, OverDrive, Clergy, Classic Literature","color":"#eae2c7","s":45,"images":[{"a":2030,"w":35,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5793462-S.jpg","s":45},{"a":53460,"w":180,"h":297,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5793462-M.jpg","s":231},{"a":151500,"w":303,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5793462-L.jpg","s":389}],"year":1867},{"id":109877,"published":-3345062400,"title":"The small house at Allington","text":"Lily Dale is sublimely happy when she becomes engaged to Adolphus Crosbie, assistant secretary in a government agency.

It is the long-awaited film from Paul Thomas Anderson, one of the most admired filmmakers working today whose previous movies, Boogie Nights and Magnolia were both multiple Academy Award nominees. The movie stars Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis (Gangs of New York, My Left Foot) and Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine).Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film in New York and Los Angeles on December 26, 2007 and go nationwide in January.

I hope so small a divergence may seem a venial error after so many centuries. For the rest, it is as accurate as a good deal of research and hard work could make it. The matter of diction is always a question of taste and discretion in a historical reproduction. In the year 1350 the upper classes still spoke Norman-French, though they were just beginning to condescend to English. The lower classes spoke the English of the original Piers Plowman text, which would be considerably more obscure than their superiors' French if the two were now reproduced or imitated.

The Virgil soon slipped unheeded to the ground, and Anne, her chin propped on her clasped hands, and her eyes on the splendid mass of fluffy clouds that were heaping up just over Mr. J. A.

He is charmed by Old World fascinations and caught up in the leisurely craft and bohemian direction of European worldliness. An older woman of rank and adventurous but subtle skill, Madame de Vionnet, strokes his ego and does her best to keep Chad in Paris indefinitely. Chad's mother lives in Woollett, Mass., and wants her son to return to run the family business. Mrs. Newsome is an invalid and cannot go to Paris to fetch her son herself, so she employs Lambert Strether and Sarah Pocock to return Chad to Massachusetts. Sarah has been to Paris before and is aware of its attractiveness, so her determination to succeed in this task is fixed and uncompromising. Strether is of later middle age, however, and inspired by the fairytale of a beautiful life in Europe. Mrs. Newsome has promised to marry Strether if he can bring Chad home. Strether is completely enamored by the Parisian character and its enchantments and has a difficult time completing his mission. The drama of reestablishing Chad in business in America and of coming to terms with the mythological romance of France leaves the reader unbalanced, trying to recover equilibrium in the real world. Those involved with Chad's rescue are compelled to recognize the deep intimacies of personal attachment and the accepted proprieties of direct consequence. The success and failures of such an undertaking are unpredictable. The result of every character's attempt to steer Chad rightly is a strange conglomeration of role reversal, fantasy, and truth.","author":"Henry James, Jr.Henry James, ","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL276470W","pop":80,"lat":48.853,"lng":2.349,"mdsy":-0.0127019,"mdsx":0.000812738,"tags":"Man-woman relationships, Classic Literature, Accessible book, Young men in fiction, Americans in fiction, Fiction, Romance, OverDrive, Americans, Historical Fiction, Protected DAISY, Young men, Man-woman relationships in fiction","color":"#eadec8","s":45,"images":[{"a":2030,"w":35,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5734952-S.jpg","s":45},{"a":53100,"w":180,"h":295,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5734952-M.jpg","s":230},{"a":152000,"w":304,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5734952-L.jpg","s":390}],"year":1903},{"id":276472,"published":-1924992000,"title":"Italian Hours","text":"James's essays on Italy are remarkable for their humanity.

With a rebellion rising against the throne at home, Hal lives it up in the ale houses of London, associating with petty schemers and masterminding practical jokes instead of military strategies. When his father sends a messenger to fetch his delinquent son, will Hal rally to the call? Written prior to 1596, this much-loved play is referred to in multiple memoirs and documents of the day and in subsequent decades, including Samuel Pepys's diary, attesting to its impact and popularity. Blending action that takes place at court with scenes of city life, HENRY IV PART 1 marks a turning-point in Shakespeare's oeuvre, as action unfolds simultaneously in diverse locations, lending texture and variety to the drama, and involving characters drawn not only from the ranks of court, but from London's seedier byways. The sway of chaos and order, the perennial theme of Shakespeare's histories, is present here in the juxtaposition of the political realm with the Epicurean.","author":"William Shakespeare","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL362697W","pop":181,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":-0.0259563,"mdsx":0.0273518,"tags":"In library, Plays, Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616.

Although it is set in Rome, the fictive world of The Marble Faun depends not on Italy's social or historical significance, but rather on its aesthetic importance as a definer of 'civilization'. As in The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne is concerned here with the nature of transgression and guilt. A murder, motivated by love, affects not only Donatello, the murderer, but his beloved Miriam and their friends Hilda and Kenyon. As he explores the reactions of each to the crime, Hawthorne dramatizes both the freedoms a new cultural model inspires and the self-censoring conformities it requires. His examination of the influence of European culture on American travellers lay the groundwork for such later works of American fiction as Mark Twain's The Innocents Abroad and Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady.","author":"Nathaniel Hawthorne","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL455336W","pop":79,"lat":41.895,"lng":12.484,"mdsy":-0.00686488,"mdsx":-0.00251187,"tags":"Murder, Nobility in fiction, Literature, Accessible book, Artists in fiction, Americans in fiction, Fiction, OverDrive, Women art students, Murder in fiction, Americans, Artists, Classic Literature, Women art students in fiction, Nobility","color":"#7b7978","s":47,"images":[{"a":2204,"w":38,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2888698-S.jpg","s":47},{"a":48600,"w":180,"h":270,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2888698-M.jpg","s":220},{"a":166500,"w":333,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2888698-L.jpg","s":408}],"year":1840},{"id":455662,"published":-3723753600,"title":"The Blithedale romance","text":"A superb depiction of a utopian community that cannot survive the individual passions of its members. In language that is suggestive and often erotic, Nathaniel Hawthorne tells a tale of failed possibilities and multiple personal betrayals as he explores the contrasts between what his characters espouse and what they actually experience in an 'ideal' community. A theme of unrealized sexual possibilities serves as a counterpoint to the other failures at Blithedale: class and sex distinctions are not eradicated, and communal work on the farm proves personally unrewarding and economically disastrous. Based in part on Hawthorne's own experiences at Brook Farm, an experimental socialist community, The Blithedale Romance is especially timely in light of renewed interest in self-sufficient and other cooperative societies.","author":"Nathaniel Hawthorne","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL455662W","pop":58,"lat":42.63,"lng":-71.163,"mdsy":-0.0157611,"mdsx":0.00244217,"tags":"History, Classic Literature, Collective settlements, Collective farms, Utopias, Massachusetts in fiction, Accessible book, Protected DAISY, In library, Fiction, Sources, OverDrive, Communal living, Farm life in fiction, Literature, Farm life, Communal living in fiction, Utopias in fiction, Collective farms in fiction","color":"#ccaf9f","s":46,"images":[{"a":2146,"w":37,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/230347-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":50040,"w":180,"h":278,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/230347-M.jpg","s":224},{"a":146608,"w":308,"h":476,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/230347-L.jpg","s":383}],"year":1852},{"id":462007,"published":-1861920000,"title":"Peter Pan","text":"Peter Pan, the “boy who would not grow up,” originally appeared as a baby living a magical life among birds and fairies in J.M. Barrie's sequence of stories, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. His later role as flying boy hero was brought to the stage by Barrie in the beloved play Peter Pan, which opened in 1904 and became the novel Peter and Wendy in 1911. In a narrative filled with vivid characters, epic battles, pirates, fairies, and fantastic imagination, Peter Pan's adventures capture the spirit of childhood—and of rebellion against the role of adulthood in conventional society.This edition includes the novel and the stories, as well as an introduction by eminent scholar Jack Zipes. Looking at the man behind Peter Pan and sifting through the psychological interpretations that have engaged many a critic, Zipes explores the larger cultural and literary contexts in which we should appreciate Barrie's enduring creation and shows why Peter Pan is a work not for children but for adults seeking to reconnect with their own imagination.*100th anniversary of the play, which premiered December 27, 1904*Includes introduction, suggestions for further reading, explanatory notes, and the original illustrations from the first edition by Francis Donkin Bedford and Arthur Rackham","author":"J.

Before the ship sinks, a strange passenger gives a young girl, Jane Finn, an important but secret government document. Jane survives the shipwreck, but the stranger dies, the girl is kidnapped, and the document is forgotten until a labor dissension starts in England; if these papers are found in the wrong hands, it would result in catastrophe for the government. Tommy and Tuppence have decided to become professional \"Adventure Seekers\" as a way of making a living. After becoming involved in a search for Jane Finn, they are contacted by Mr. Carter from Intelligence, Mr. Brown who is a nondescript man manipulating the labor unrest, and Julius P. Hersheimmer who is an American millionaire and cousin to the girl. The detective duo must engage their wits, personal appeal, and enterprising spirit with a mystery that predicts, if all goes wrong, certain death for Jane at the hands of an ominous secret enemy.

As I think of this I remember Ranger Sitter when he made that remark, while he grimly stroked an unhealed bullet wound. And I remember the giant Vaughn, that typical son of stalwart Texas, sitting there quietly with bandaged head, his thoughtful eye boding ill to the outlaw who had ambushed him.

Why, fool, a Poet is as much as one should say, - a Poet!\" And thou, reader, dost thou know what a hero is? Why, a hero is as much as one should say, - a hero! Some romance-writers, however, say much more than this. Nay, the old Lombard, Matteo Maria Bojardo, set all the church-bells in Scandiano ringing, merely because he had found a name for one of his heroes. Here, also, shall church-bells be rung, but more solemnly. The setting of a great hope is like the setting of the sun. The brightness of our life is gone. Shadows of evening fall around us, and the world seems but a dim reflection, - itself a broader shadow. We look forward into the coming, lonely night. The soul withdraws into itself. Then stars arise, and the night is holy. Paul Flemming had experienced this, though still young. The friend of his youth was dead. The bough had broken \"under the burden of the unripe fruit.\" And when, after a season, he looked up again from the blindness of his sorrow, all things seemed unreal. Like the man, whose sight had been restored by miracle, he beheld men, as trees, walking. His household gods were broken. He had no home. His sympathies cried aloud from his desolate soul, and there came no answer from the busy, turbulent world around him. He did not willingly give way to grief. He struggled to be cheerful, - to be strong. But he could no longer look into the familiar faces of his friends. He could no longer live alone, where he had lived with her. He went abroad, that the sea might be between him and the grave. Alas! Between him and his sorrow there could be no sea, but that of time.","author":"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL496002W","pop":53,"lat":48.691,"lng":9.141,"mdsy":-0.00675219,"mdsx":-0.00101476,"tags":"Description and travel, Accessible book, Fiction, OverDrive, Europe in fiction, Classic Literature","color":"#f5e3bd","s":46,"images":[{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5890807-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":156500,"w":313,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5890807-L.jpg","s":396},{"a":51660,"w":180,"h":287,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5890807-M.jpg","s":227}],"year":1839},{"id":497200,"published":788918400,"title":"Intensity","text":"Chyna Shepherd is a twenty-six-year-old woman whose deeply troubled childhood taught her the hard rules of survival, and whose adult life has been an unrelenting struggle for self-respect and safety. Now rare trust has blossomed for Chyna into friendship with the woman whose family home she is visiting for the weekend: a farm in the Napa Valley surrounded by vineyards and hills, which Chyna can see from the guest-room window where she sits at one o'clock in the morning, fully dressed, unable to sleep. \r\n\r\nSuspicions she learned in childhood still make her uneasy in unfamiliar houses--even this one, where her closest friend is sound asleep down the hall. And in this case her most disturbing instincts prove reliable. A man has entered the house, a man who lives for one purpose: to satisfy all appetites as they arise, to immerse himself in sensation, to live without fear, remorse, or limits--to live with intensity.\r\n\r\nHis name is Edgler Foreman Vess. He likes to make words with the letters from his name--GOD, DEMON, SAVE, RAGE, ANGER, FEAR, FOREVER, are just a few of them--and then makes sentences with the words. One of his favorites, GOD FEARS ME, is sometimes the last thing he whispers to his victims. Edgler Vess is a self-proclaimed \"homicidal adventurer\": On this night, his adventure--murdering everyone in the house--becomes Chyna's long nightmare.\r\n\r\nTrapped in Vess's deadly orbit, Chyna thinks only of getting out alive. But when she inadvertently learns the identity of Vess's intended next victim, waiting for him far from Napa Valley, Chyna is gripped with concern for this other person, who is as innocent as Chyna, and as endangered. Driven now by a sense of responsibility for another, by a purpose and meaning beyond mere self-preservation, Chyna rises to unexpected heights of courage and daring--her only hope as the threat of Edgler Foreman Vess closes in and grows more horrifying moment by moment.\r\n\r\nIntensity unfolds over the course of just twenty-four hours, but within that brief time frame, Dean Koontz gives us what is perhaps his most inventive, emotionally intricate, and terrifyingly suspenseful novel yet.

Begun in 1845, the year Louis Philippe conferred a peerage and a lifetime seat in the Senate upon Victor Hugo, it was completed when the author was living in exile in the Channel Islands. Les Miserables is a product as well as a document of the political, social, and religious upheaval that followed the Napoleonic Wars and Europe's great democratic revolutions. The story is centered on Jean Valjean, a peasant who enters the novel a hardened criminal after nineteen years spent in prison for stealing a loaf of bread for the starving children of his sister. The path of Valjean's last twenty-five years, leading from the French provinces to the battlefield of Waterloo and the ramparts of Paris during the Uprising of 1832, introduces us to secret societies of revolutionaries and the vast world of the French lower classes. Jean Valjean's flight from the police agent Javert--the prototype of over a hundred years of fictional detectives--culminates in one of the most famous scenes in all literature, the chase through the sewers of Paris. Les Miserables sold out its large first printing in twenty-four hours and has remained enormously popular. This edition is the classic English translation of Hugo's friend Charles Wilbour, which appeared the same year the novel was published in France.","author":"Victor Hugo","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1063591W","pop":107,"lat":48.853,"lng":2.349,"mdsy":-0.0058124,"mdsx":0.00259353,"tags":"Social life and customs, In library, France in fiction, Accessible book, Fiction, Protected DAISY","color":"#bab19a","s":46,"images":[{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5785176-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":50940,"w":180,"h":283,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5785176-M.jpg","s":226},{"a":158500,"w":317,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5785176-L.jpg","s":398}],"year":1862},{"id":1085430,"published":-11297404800,"title":"The alchemist","text":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge said of Ben Jonson's The Alchemist that it had one out of the three most perfect plots in literature.

My father had left me that afternoon, after delivering himself of a few plain precepts, strongly expressed, for my guidance in the new course of life on which I was entering. I was to be a clerk under the engineer who had undertaken to make the little branch line from Eltham to Hornby. My father had got me this situation, which was in a position rather above his own in life; or perhaps I should say, above the station in which he was born and bred; for he was raising himself every year in men's consideration and respect. He was a mechanic by trade, but he had some inventive genius, and a great deal of perseverance, and had devised several valuable improvements in railway machinery. He did not do this for profit, though, as was reasonable, what came in the natural course of things was acceptable; he worked out his ideas, because, as he said, 'until he could put them into shape, they plagued him by night and by day.' But this is enough about my dear father; it is a good thing for a country where there are many like him. He was a sturdy Independent by descent and conviction; and this it was, I believe, which made him place me in the lodgings at the pastry-cook's.","author":"Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1103198W","pop":32,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":-0.0110976,"mdsx":-0.00245923,"tags":"Social life and customs, Cousins, Accessible book, Fiction, England in fiction, OverDrive, Clergy, Unrequited love, Classic Literature","color":"#fdfdfd","s":48,"images":[{"a":2262,"w":39,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5813962-S.jpg","s":48},{"a":47880,"w":180,"h":266,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5813962-M.jpg","s":219},{"a":168500,"w":337,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5813962-L.jpg","s":410}],"year":1865},{"id":1103200,"published":-3281904000,"title":"Wives and daughters","text":"Seventeen-year-old Molly Gibson worships her widowed father.

There are records still extant in the present Mr. Edgeworth's possession, - papers of most wonderful vitality for parchment, - where you may read passionate remonstrances and adjurations from great-grandfathers to great-great-grandfathers, and where great-great-grandmothers rush into the discussion with vehement spelling and remonstrance, and make matters no better by their interference.","author":"Maria Edgeworth","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1124049W","pop":37,"lat":53,"lng":-8,"mdsy":-0.0166051,"mdsx":-0.00548523,"tags":"Rich people, Social life and customs, Poor families, Accessible book, Fiction in English, Fiction, OverDrive, Administration of estates, Landlord and tenant, Rural conditions, Classic Literature, Landowners","color":"#cc5c47","s":46,"images":[{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/118565-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":52020,"w":180,"h":289,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/118565-M.jpg","s":228},{"a":140125,"w":295,"h":475,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/118565-L.jpg","s":374}],"year":1800},{"id":1130095,"published":-3376598400,"title":"The water-babies","text":"When Tom, an ill-treated little chimney-sweep, jumps into a clear, cool stream to clean himself something magical happens; he is turned into a tiny water baby by the fairies.

It was only half past eight, but the month was April, and there was a closeness in the air, a threat of the long, stifling midday hours. Occasional faint breaths of wind, seeming cool by contrast, stirred the newly drenched orchids that hung from the eaves. Beyond the orchids one could see the dusty, curved trunk of a palm tree, and then the blazing ultramarine sky. Up in the zenith, so high that it dazzled one to look at them, a few vultures circled without the quiver of a wing. Unblinking, rather like a great porcelain idol, U Po Kyin gazed out into the fierce sunlight. He was a man of fifty, so fat that for years he had not risen from his chair without help, and yet shapely and even beautiful in his grossness; for the Burmese do not sag and bulge like white men, but grow fat symmetrically, like fruits swelling. His face was vast, yellow and quite unwrin-kled, and his eyes were tawny. His feet—squat, high-arched feet with the toes all the same length—were bare, and so was his cropped head, and he wore one of those vivid Arakanese longyis with green and magenta checks which the Burmese wear on informal occasions. He was chewing betel from a lacquered box on the table, and thinking about his past life.","author":"George Orwell","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1168015W","pop":38,"lat":22,"lng":98,"mdsy":-0.00751917,"mdsx":-0.00395186,"tags":"Burma in fiction, Fiction in English, OverDrive, Imperialism in fiction, Imperialismo, Fiction, Colonies in fiction, Imperialism, Colonias, Great Britain in fiction, Social conditions, Colonies, Classic Literature, Ficción","color":"#a2b9a2","s":46,"images":[{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5344336-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":26112,"w":128,"h":204,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5344336-M.jpg","s":162}],"year":1934},{"id":1168030,"published":-1167609600,"title":"Down and Out in Paris and London","text":"'You have talked so often of going to the dogs – and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them.'

The happiness of a pal - two pals, in fact - is at stake. But somehow Bertie's best-laid plans land everyone in the soup, and so it's just as well that Jeeves is ever at hand to apply his bulging brains to the problems of young love.","author":"P. G.

While testing his invention with his financial backer and former student David Innes, the machine malfunctions and the pair end up burrowing deep into the earth to emerge in Pellucidar, a lush underground cavern filled with giant prehistoric creatures. While fleeing one such creature, Dr. Perry and David are captured by strange inhuman soldiers, called Sagoths, and placed with other human slaves, where they meet Ghak and the beautiful Princess Dia. Dia is kidnapped by another human named Hoojah the Sly One, while Dr. Perry, David and the slaves are taken to the city of the Majars, large telepathic bird-like creatures that rule the underground world. While David is sent to repair the walls that protect the city from the molten lava, Dr. Perry is sent to transcribe books in the Majar's library. David is able to escape his captors and finds a secret passage out of the Majar city. Outside, David meets Ra, the chief of a human tribe. David suggests that Ra organize the tribes to defeat the Majar but Ra shows David the Majar's true power by taking him to the Majar's grotto where he witnesses one of the Majars hypnotize a female slave before swooping down and carrying her off in its powerful talons. While sneaking back into the city, David and Ra are captured and forced to battle a huge monster but they prevail, killing a Majar in the process. Seeing that the Majar are not invincible, the slaves revolt, allowing David and Ra to escape with Ghak and Dr. Perry. Along the way, Dr. Perry shows David the 'secret of the Majar', a nursery where all the Majar are born. David vows to destroy the Majars but first, he must rescue Dia from Jubal the Ugly One. With the aid of Ra and Ghak, David unites the human tribes and arms them with primitive weapons but the telepathic Majar are prepared for their attack. At first, the battle doesn't go well, with Dia and Dr. Perry being captured but Ra is able to destroy the nursery by unleashing the lava at the cost of his own life. Hypnotized by a Majar, Dia is about to be killed when David and the other humans arrive to save her and Dr. Perry. As the humans flee the city, it is consumed by lava, killing all the Majar. Returning to the surface, David asks Dia to come with him but she says she cannot and the two sadly part company.","author":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1418234W","pop":34,"lat":0,"lng":0,"mdsy":-0.00386251,"mdsx":0.00735643,"tags":"American Science fiction, Core, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Juvenile Fiction, Fiction, Science fiction, OverDrive, Protected DAISY, Earth, Classic Literature, Accessible book","color":"#f7f7f7","s":46,"images":[{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6330375-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":51120,"w":180,"h":284,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6330375-M.jpg","s":226},{"a":158000,"w":316,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6330375-L.jpg","s":397}],"year":1914},{"id":1418241,"published":-1356998400,"title":"The Outlaw of Torn","text":"From the book:Here is a story that has lain dormant for seven hundred years.

I think at least the idea of the story that an infant is raised by a she-ape, teaches himself reading from books in the cabin of his parents, developing high intellectual abilities and becoming master and king of the jungle – that’s enough to mention this novel in fantasy literature. \r\n\r\nLinks \r\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan_of_the_Apes \r\nwith more interesting links. \r\n\r\nThe text of the novel can be downloaded free of charge from Gutenberg Projekt.

Carefully removing his bandages, he realizes that he is the only person who can see: everyone else, doctors and patients alike, have been blinded by a meteor shower. Now, with civilization in chaos, the triffids - huge, venomous, large-rooted plants able to 'walk', feeding on human flesh - can have their day.The Day of the Triffids, published in 1951, expresses many of the political concerns of its time: the Cold War, the fear of biological experimentation and the man-made apocalypse. However, with its terrifyingly believable insights into the genetic modification of plants, the book is more relevant today than ever before.\r\n\r\n[Comment by Liz Jensen on The Guardian][1]:\r\n\r\n> As a teenager, one of my favourite haunts was Oxford's Botanical Gardens. I'd head straight for the vast heated greenhouses, where I'd pity my adolescent plight, chain-smoke, and glory in the insane vegetation that burgeoned there. The more rampant, brutally spiked, poisonous, or cruel to insects a plant was, the more it appealed to me. I'd shove my butts into their root systems. They could take it. My librarian mother disapproved mightily of the fags but when under interrogation I confessed where I'd been hanging out – hardly Sodom and Gomorrah – she spotted a literary opportunity, and slid John Wyndham's The Day of the Triffids my way. I read it in one sitting, fizzing with the excitement of recognition. I knew the triffids already: I'd spent long hours in the jungle with them, exchanging gases. Wyndham loved to address the question that triggers every invented world: the great \"What if . . .\" What if a carnivorous, travelling, communicating, poison-spitting oil-rich plant, harvested in Britain as biofuel, broke loose after a mysterious \"comet-shower\" blinded most of the population? That's the scenario faced by triffid-expert Bill Masen, who finds himself a sighted man in a sightless nation. Cataclysmic change established, cue a magnificent chain reaction of experimental science, physical and political crisis, moral dilemmas, new hierarchies, and hints of a new world order. Although the repercussions of an unprecedented crisis and Masen's personal journey through the new wilderness form the backbone of the story, it's the triffids that root themselves most firmly in the reader's memory. Wyndham described them botanically, but he left enough room for the reader's imagination to take over. The result being that everyone who reads The Day of the Triffids creates, in their mind's eye, their own version of fiction's most iconic plant. Mine germinated in an Oxford greenhouse, in a cloud of cigarette smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/may/14/science-fiction-authors-choice","author":"John Wyndham","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL1911336W","pop":32,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":-0.000173393,"mdsx":0.00876438,"tags":"Blind, English Fantasy fiction, Translations into Russian, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Horror, Fiction in English, Fiction, Meteorites, OverDrive, Science fiction, Large type books, Fantasy fiction, English, Classic Literature, Plant mutation","color":"#664f47","s":47,"images":[{"a":2204,"w":38,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/535027-S.jpg","s":47},{"a":49320,"w":180,"h":274,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/535027-M.jpg","s":222},{"a":148200,"w":312,"h":475,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/535027-L.jpg","s":385}],"year":1951},{"id":1940393,"published":-2398291200,"title":"Trilby","text":"In the Latin Quarter of Paris, Trilby O'Ferrall - graceful, charming and innocent - is working as an artist's model.

It is based on a story in Painter's \"Palace of Pleasure,\" translated from the Italian novelist, Bandello; and it is entirely possible that it has a foundation in fact. In any case, it portrays with a terrible vividness one side of the court life of the Italian Renaissance; and its picture of the fierce quest of pleasure, the recklessness of crime, and the worldliness of the great princes of the Church finds only too ready corroboration in the annals of the time.\r\n\r\nOf John Webster's life almost nothing is known. The dates 1580-1625 given for his birth and death are conjectural inferences, about which the best that can be said is that no known facts contradict them.The first notice of Webster so far discovered shows that he was collaborating in the production of plays for the theatrical manager, Henslowe, in 1602, and of such collaboration he seems to have done a considerable amount. Four plays exist which he wrote alone, \"The White Devil,\" \"The Duchess of Malfi,\" \"The Devil's Law-Case,\" and \"Appius and Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nWebster's tragedies come toward the close of the great series of tragedies of blood and revenge, in which \"The Spanish Tragedy\" and \"Hamlet\" are landmarks, but before decadence can fairly be said to have set in. He, indeed, loads his scene with horrors almost past the point which modern taste can bear; but the intensity of his dramatic situations, and his superb power of flashing in a single line a light into the recesses of the human heart at the crises of supreme emotion, redeems him from mere sensationalism, and places his best things in the first rank of dramatic writing.","author":"Webster, John","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2011725W","pop":55,"lat":42.833,"lng":12.833,"mdsy":-0.013608,"mdsx":0.00732721,"tags":"In library, Married women, Brothers and sisters, English drama, Accessible book, History and criticism, Revenge, Fiction, Drama, Stage history, Protected DAISY, OverDrive, Nobility, Kommentar","color":"#867c31","s":46,"images":[{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6491571-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":51480,"w":180,"h":286,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6491571-M.jpg","s":227},{"a":157000,"w":314,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6491571-L.jpg","s":396}],"year":1640},{"id":2047674,"published":-536457600,"title":"The Go-Between","text":"Narrated as a memoir, this excellent novel tells the story of one summer at the turn of the century when the narrator was a young boy.

When Eliphalet came to town, his son's wife, Mrs. Samuel D. (or S. Dwyer as she is beginning to call herself), was not born. Gentlemen of Cavalier and Puritan descent had not yet begun to arrive at the Planters' House, to buy hunting shirts and broad rims, belts and bowies, and depart quietly for Kansas, there to indulge in that; most pleasurable of Anglo-Saxon pastimes, a free fight. Mr. Douglas had not thrown his bone of Local Sovereignty to the sleeping dogs of war.  To return to Eliphalet's arrival, - a picture which has much that is interesting in it. Behold the friendless boy he stands in the prow of the great steamboat 'Louisiana' of a scorching summer morning, and looks with something of a nameless disquiet on the chocolate waters of the Mississippi. There have been other sights, since passing Louisville, which might have disgusted a Massachusetts lad more. A certain deck on the 'Paducah', which took him as far as Cairo, was devoted to cattle - black cattle. Eliphalet possessed a fortunate temperament. The deck was dark, and the smell of the wretches confined there was worse than it should have been. And the incessant weeping of some of the women was annoying, inasmuch as it drowned many of the profane communications of the overseer who was showing Eliphalet the sights. Then a fine-linened planter from down river had come in during the conversation, and paying no attention to the overseer's salute cursed them all into silence, and left.","author":"Winston Churchill","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2341858W","pop":55,"lat":39.76,"lng":-98.5,"mdsy":-0.00875007,"mdsx":0.00717359,"tags":"United States in fiction, Accessible book, Fiction, Drama, OverDrive, United States Civil War, 1861-1865, Classic Literature, History","color":"#f5f0c4","s":226,"images":[{"a":50940,"w":180,"h":283,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5628069-M.jpg","s":226},{"a":159000,"w":318,"h":500,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5628069-L.jpg","s":399},{"a":2088,"w":36,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5628069-S.jpg","s":46}],"year":1901},{"id":2346083,"published":-2840140800,"title":"Ben Hur","text":"A bestseller since 1880...The classic saga of the Roman EmpireFrom a thrilling sea battle to its famous chariot race to the agony of the Crucifixion, this is the epic tale of a prince who became a slave and by a twist of fate and his own skill-won a chance at freedom.","author":"Lew Wallace","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2346083W","pop":117,"lat":41.895,"lng":12.484,"mdsy":0.000558455,"mdsx":0.0182213,"tags":"Bible, Protected DAISY, Jesus Christ in fiction, Spanish language books, Readers, Translations into German, Juvenile fiction, Rome in fiction, Spanish language, Fiction, Christian fiction, Bible. in fiction, English fiction, History of Biblical events, German language books, Tiberius, in fiction, Accessible book, History","color":"#6e574e","s":47,"images":[{"a":2204,"w":38,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1956505-S.jpg","s":47},{"a":48600,"w":180,"h":270,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1956505-M.jpg","s":220},{"a":150100,"w":316,"h":475,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1956505-L.jpg","s":387}],"year":1880},{"id":2384132,"published":-946771200,"title":"Cry, the Beloved Country","text":"Set in South Africa this novel was written shortly before apartheid became the official policy of the white South African government and was intended to draw attention to the social structures current at that time, many of which would lead directly to apartheid.","author":"Paton, Alan.Alan Paton, ","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2384132W","pop":38,"lat":-30,"lng":26,"mdsy":-0.00674919,"mdsx":0.01227,"tags":"Apartheid in literature, Race relations, Textbooks for foreign speakers, Apartheid, Accessible book, English language, Fiction, Race relations in literature, Protected DAISY, Large type books, In literature","color":"#9fa1a9","s":49,"images":[{"a":2378,"w":41,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4963700-S.jpg","s":49},{"a":23040,"w":128,"h":180,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4963700-L.jpg","s":152}],"year":1940},{"id":2386322,"published":-347155200,"title":"The Leopard (Il gattopardo)","text":"The acclaimed novel by Lampedusa gives an exquisite portrait of a despotic Sicilian aristocrat.

The social themes of Our Mutual Friend--having to do with the treatment of the poor, education, representative government, even the inheritance laws--are informed and brought into coherence by the underlying presence of the Thames, signifying the perpetual flow of life into death, and acting as agent of retribution and regeneration too, as a kind of river god in fact, in a novel in which no other god is very present.","author":"Charles Dickens","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL14869440W","pop":95,"lat":51.509,"lng":-0.126,"mdsy":-0.0150855,"mdsx":0.000759905,"tags":"Social life and customs, Classic Literature, Deception, Poor families, Social classes in fiction, Accessible book, Social classes, Inheritance and succession in fiction, OverDrive, Inheritance and succession, Protected DAISY, Poor families in fiction, Fiction, Deception in fiction, Materialism","color":"#944d40","s":47,"images":[{"a":2204,"w":38,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/119281-S.jpg","s":47},{"a":48780,"w":180,"h":271,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/119281-M.jpg","s":221},{"a":149625,"w":315,"h":475,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/119281-L.jpg","s":387}],"year":1800},{"id":14870146,"published":-5364662400,"title":"The uncommercial traveller","text":"A collection of seventeen sketches which grew out of Dickens' insomnia.

Gray wishes that his portrait, and not himself, might age and show the effects of time. His wish comes true, and wild, hedonistic pursuits horribly disfigure the portrait. This Faustian story caused much controversy when it was first published, as it discusses decadent art and culture, and homosexuality. It is now considered one of the great pieces of modern Western literature.","author":"Oscar Wilde","link":"http://openlibrary.org/works/OL14877883W","pop":134,"lat":54,"lng":-4,"mdsy":-0.0199209,"mdsx":0.00823886,"tags":"Conduct of life, Accessible book, Youthfulness, Fiction, OverDrive, Supernatural, Translations into Yiddish, Appearance (Philosophy), Future life in fiction, Great Britain in fiction, Soul in fiction, Classic Literature, Juventud, Youthfulness in fiction, Soul, Conducta (Ética), Aspecto (Filosofía), Portraits in fiction, History, Conduct of life in fiction, Supernatural in fiction, Portraits, Conducta (Etica), Future life, Protected DAISY, Retratos, Ficción, Novela didáctica","color":"#846a37","s":46,"images":[{"a":2146,"w":37,"h":58,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3815998-S.jpg","s":46},{"a":25344,"w":128,"h":198,"t":0,"url":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3815998-M.jpg","s":159}],"year":1891},{"id":15035771,"published":-3881520000,"title":"Wuthering Heights","text":"There are few more convincing, less sentimental accounts of love than Wuthering Heights.
